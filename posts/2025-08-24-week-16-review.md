excerpt: Extra Responsibilities
---

This week started a month of having some extra responsibilities that are going to seriously cut down on the amount of time I can work on the conference outside of work.  I had planned to get something set up to open the CFP and ticket sales soon but I think I will postpone those until the end of September now. This is why I started early I suppose.

I reached out to a couple more potential keynote speakers and I got a yes from one! Kieran Klaassen is a long time Ruby and Rails developer and is currently leading the development of Cora, an AI email assistant. He is a huge advocate of AI assisted coding and I am excited to learn from him. He acknowledged that he doesn't have any idea what he will be talking about next summer because things move so fast these days and I totally get it. Who knows where we will be in 9 months.

I would like to get one or two more sponsors. I can fit in sending a couple messages over the next couple weeks, even with my other responsibilities. That will probably be the only thing I will work on though. These weekly reviews may be a bit sparse. All in all I feel like I am in a good place. We are still 9 months out from the conference and I have a venue, 2 potential sponsors, and 2 potential keynote speakers. I say "potential" because the sponsor money isn't in the bank and the speakers haven't signed anything. But still a very good start.
