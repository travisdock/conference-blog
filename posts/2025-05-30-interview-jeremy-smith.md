I had a very inspiring talk with Jeremy and he gave me a lot to think about. A couple things that stood out to me:

On delegating tasks to other people when organizing a conference (or doing anything difficult really) he said, “I think that works really well when you know what the job is to do. But if you’ve never done the job and you haven’t seen it done well, how do you even know what needs to be done?” This is something that I have really been struggling with. I know I will need help but how to get that help and have it be effective is tough for me (a sign I need to build this skill obviously).

Make marketing materials for other conferences! He put out mailers with custom made stickers on them on tables at Railsconf (maybe) and people picked them up! This is something I can definitely do.

When talking about getting sponsors the first time, especially when you don’t have a network to tap into, he said the best advice he got was: “…brand or the conference itself is not what you are selling, you are selling you.” This is a great point. Because I don’t have a history of organizing conferences or a wide network or social media following, the sponsors are really taking a chance on me. I need to convince them that I am the one that will make the conference successful, not the other way around. Ask the sponsors, “What do you need from me to make this successful?”

One thing that he thinks made a big impact on him and the conference itself was the period at the very beginning where he gave people the chance to get on the mic and say something positive that happened to them in the Ruby community. That sounds so cool. I really want to steal this for my conference.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:02.939
Travis Dockter: Alrighty sounds good. Well, welcome to this very unofficial, unprofessional off the cuff sort of

12
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:11.180
Travis Dockter: informational interview series. That I'm doing here. I've just been kind of

13
00:01:12.193 --> 00:01:17.626
Travis Dockter: reaching out to different conference organizers for context here and

14
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:33.370
Travis Dockter: doing these recorded interviews in hopes that I can soak up a little bit of your knowledge, and also that I can put these out for other people who are looking to to organize conferences.

15
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.120
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, that's cool.

16
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:43.470
Travis Dockter: And yeah. So you are the originator of Blue Ridge Ruby. Right?

17
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.130
Jeremy Smith: Yeah.

18
00:01:44.527 --> 00:01:48.100
Travis Dockter: And that start that was in 2023.

19
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.010
Jeremy Smith: That's right. Yeah.

20
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.920
Travis Dockter: Okay, cool. Can you? Just on a high level? Just tell me

21
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.909
Travis Dockter: how that 1st experience was like, how did it 1st start? And then

22
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.589
Travis Dockter: how did it go? And just on a on a high level.

23
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.583
Jeremy Smith: Yeah. Okay.

24
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.229
Jeremy Smith: The that year before, I think 2022,

25
00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:12.780
Jeremy Smith: was a really pivotal year for me

26
00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:18.552
Jeremy Smith: professionally, and in being and even involvement in the ruby and rails. Community.

27
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.450
Jeremy Smith: I think, coming out of Covid

28
00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:37.430
Jeremy Smith: and after having spent 10 years working remotely from home. I was feeling pretty disconnected from people in general, and had sort of, I think a lot of people had this like this renewed sense of like I need to be around other people, I need to.

29
00:02:37.550 --> 00:03:00.000
Jeremy Smith: you know, pursue some things that I suddenly couldn't pursue and saw like a need for in my own life. So in 2022, I I kind of went all out and went to a bunch of conferences, and I work for myself. I've been doing that since 2013, and for many years it was just hard to justify the cost of conferences a lot of times to myself, thinking like, what am I going to get out of this like

30
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.099
Jeremy Smith: that's, gonna you know, make the

31
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.100
Jeremy Smith: anywhere from a thousand to 3,000, you know that I throw down on a conference like Worth. It.

32
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.870
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

33
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:31.960
Jeremy Smith: And I finally, in 2022 was like, you know what screw it? I I want to do this. This is just like. If this is my career. This is what I love doing. If I've been doing Rivian rail since 2,009, and I love this and can't see myself leaving like, why can't I just do this for myself? Cause this is what I'm doing, you know.

34
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.800
Jeremy Smith: Maybe for the rest of my life. So

35
00:03:34.523 --> 00:03:40.546
Jeremy Smith: I ended up going to several conferences. One was Sin City Ruby.

36
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.050
Jeremy Smith: and then I went to my 1st railsconf in Portland, and then there was Rubyconf Mini in Providence.

37
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:58.300
Jeremy Smith: and rail sas in La. And 3 of those conferences were. It was the 1st time those conferences had happened.

38
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.719
Jeremy Smith: So Sin City was Jason's first, st

39
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:14.061
Jeremy Smith: and then ruby cough, Mini, I mean, you could argue there's ruby cough, but Rubicoff Mini was like a a 1 off and has slightly different format, and it was put together

40
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:26.980
Jeremy Smith: by people who had hadn't done a conference before. And and then rail. Sas was Andrew Culver's project in La. And so, although I got to see like the 1st time something had happened.

41
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:38.410
Jeremy Smith: and with all of this kind of in rapid succession. I guess not rapid, but over the course of the year it gave me a lot of context for what I liked or didn't like in conferences and kind could kind of compare like.

42
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:48.130
Jeremy Smith: oh, what did I get out a lot out of? And what did other people seem to enjoy? And oh, I really like this piece from this and that, you know, like this piece, I would steal that from that one.

43
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.630
Jeremy Smith: and by the time I was coming home from rail. Sas, I think it was

44
00:04:54.135 --> 00:05:00.850
Jeremy Smith: I just like randomly tweeted out like man. I'd love to put on a ruby conference. You know, like.

45
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:17.050
Jeremy Smith: And I'd had this idea of like, okay, I live in Greenville, South Carolina. Most people have not heard of Greenville, or you know, they only know Charleston and South Carolina usually, but I know a lot of people liked Asheville and North Carolina. I used to live there for a slight, a small period of time, and

46
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:37.839
Jeremy Smith: it's 1 1 of the favorite places I've ever been spent time in, and had it. They have great, you know, food, beer, music, scenes. People come there for their weddings. People come there to, you know, for travel and for outdoor adventures and things like that. But that would be a cool town to have a conference in

47
00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:41.426
Jeremy Smith: and so I just like tweeted out like, hey? What if

48
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.300
Jeremy Smith: what you know? What if I put on like a

49
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:57.470
Jeremy Smith: a ruby conference? Would anyone come to Blue Ridge Ruby in Asheville, and had all these people like I didn't have a big twitter following. Had all these people like responding like, Heck, yeah, do it like, I would love that like, please. And it was like

50
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.219
Jeremy Smith: one of the 1st times I'd put something out, even in just tweet form that was like.

51
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.370
Jeremy Smith: Felt like it had something to it, you know, like. Had some traction behind it, like, Oh.

52
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.890
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

53
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:15.609
Jeremy Smith: This isn't just me, like other people would seem like they would be up for this, too, and if that was any indication like, maybe I could sell some tickets to this

54
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.670
Jeremy Smith: and

55
00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:29.499
Jeremy Smith: and then that year also was like a year. I was really pushing myself to do kind of new things and adventurous things. And so by the end of 2022 after that tweet, and

56
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.620
Jeremy Smith: the experience of just really great experiences at all these conferences.

57
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.580
Jeremy Smith: I thought, like maybe I should give this a shot like

58
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:49.279
Jeremy Smith: so by one of the things that really helped, though, was, I was really nervous about doing this myself. But one of the people that responded, was my Co. Organizer, Mark, and he's like I live in Nashville. I'll help you out.

59
00:06:49.763 --> 00:06:54.010
Jeremy Smith: And that was just like, Oh, okay, I've got somebody that would.

60
00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:05.550
Jeremy Smith: you know, be there with me through like what could be a heck of a ride, you know, like might go badly, and I would need somebody there if things did. You know. I'm a pretty like

61
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.135
Jeremy Smith: emotional person, so big highs, big lows. And

62
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.830
Jeremy Smith: I knew that it would be helpful if things went badly to have somebody that could provide some stability like, remove

63
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.476
Jeremy Smith: gonna be okay. We'll get through this and

64
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:32.890
Jeremy Smith: and but we we decided to pull the trigger on it. And the thing that that kind of the 1st thing was like figuring out like the the venue. And that's really like

65
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:42.940
Jeremy Smith: it feels like it all comes together when you decide like a venue. Because if you. You can't set dates or really do anything until you know where it's gonna be and can like get a

66
00:07:43.466 --> 00:07:46.320
Jeremy Smith: get, get an agreement in place. And so

67
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:52.579
Jeremy Smith: I'd been to Asheville is like an hour north of us, and I've been to one or 2

68
00:07:53.287 --> 00:08:15.529
Jeremy Smith: show like music shows that like at this really cool theater. In a Masonic temple of all places like like this, really old Masonic Temple, they had a beautiful theater like for stage productions and stuff on the 3rd floor, but sometimes it was used for weddings, and sometimes you know, like singer songwriters would come through and and play sets there.

69
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.542
Jeremy Smith: and I was like this is, this would be such a cool place to do

70
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:39.939
Jeremy Smith: do a do a conference, and for me, like the setting and the aesthetic is like matters a lot. And so we we checked this place out and decided to go for it, and as soon as I had money down. Then then you're off to the races. So that was in November of 2022 December, I think, when we finally

71
00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:49.299
Jeremy Smith: sign the agreement, and then it was kind of a mad dash until May. To get everything done to make make that happen.

72
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.355
Jeremy Smith: And

73
00:08:51.470 --> 00:09:03.389
Jeremy Smith: you know, building a brand from scratch starting social media trying to get some kind of presence like built, you know, marketing. figuring out how a Cfp works. Actually, when I started I was like

74
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:20.300
Jeremy Smith: people were like, Oh, where's the Cfp. And I was like, Oh, maybe I guess maybe I should do a Cfp. It's like that, you know. So like figuring out a lot of that stuff as I went. Oh, how do I do? Registration? Okay, I guess I'll use stripe or like, you know, all this stuff like.

75
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.870
Travis Dockter: Okay.

76
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:33.983
Jeremy Smith: and it was just kind of. I see my pants in a lot of ways, but I put a lot of time, you know, like I made up for my naivety by just putting in a lot of time

77
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:59.980
Jeremy Smith: and a lot of time over the over those 5 or 6 months, and that, and talking to a bunch of organizers, I talked to 7 different conference organizers so kind of like you just like new. I didn't know what I was getting into. I needed to get like the wisdom of other people that had done this, and every person I talked to was super gracious, encouraging, and told me something that I didn't know, that I needed to know, and that was really helpful.

78
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.220
Travis Dockter: Gosh!

79
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.282
Jeremy Smith: Yeah. And and then, yeah, the the days arrived. And

80
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:14.050
Jeremy Smith: we had, I think, 100 1,020 people total and

81
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:34.260
Jeremy Smith: a lot of people had really good things to say. There were. There were some hard things, but mostly some like it was. It was just amazing like, people really enjoyed it had a lot of good things to say about it. It felt like people really had a good time together. And that was super rewarding and fulfilling. So yeah.

82
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.030
Travis Dockter: Cool.

83
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:40.880
Travis Dockter: So so that was you said it was like 5 to 6 months. Total time.

84
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:41.850
Travis Dockter: Okay.

85
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.629
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, I wouldn't want to do it in less than 5. I know that now.

86
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.169
Travis Dockter: Yeah. But that was.

87
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:47.850
Jeremy Smith: Doable.

88
00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:56.759
Travis Dockter: So I listened to your indie rails. Last episode where you and Jason.

89
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.930
Jeremy Smith: And Adrian, yeah.

90
00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.810
Travis Dockter: Who's the friend?

91
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:12.220
Travis Dockter: Yeah. So a couple organizers all just kind of talked about your conference organizing experiences. So that was super helpful. But you mentioned, I think

92
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.289
Travis Dockter: you estimated it at like 250 h of work.

93
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:16.840
Jeremy Smith: Yeah.

94
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.730
Travis Dockter: Was that just for you? Or was that you and your Co. Organizer.

95
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.950
Jeremy Smith: That was just me that was not including the other volunteers who were also doing things. Yeah.

96
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.320
Travis Dockter: Okay, how did you guys kind of split up work? Cause I've

97
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:39.070
Travis Dockter: originally, I was like, Oh, I'll just do it myself. And everybody that I've talked to has said, you should have

98
00:11:39.983 --> 00:11:45.419
Travis Dockter: core co-organizers, you know. Some help if you can. And my

99
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:54.760
Travis Dockter: thought was like, Okay, but then like, how do you split up work? And am I like making it more complex by bringing other people in? And

100
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.239
Travis Dockter: that's what people don't.

101
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.210
Jeremy Smith: Understand that.

102
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.430
Travis Dockter: To help with this? Yeah, the.

103
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:04.349
Jeremy Smith: Thing everyone says is, that's too much work. You need to like build a team. And but like

104
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:10.110
Jeremy Smith: either, they're already good delegators and know how to build teams, or they don't understand

105
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.979
Jeremy Smith: that that is a job in itself.

106
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.840
Travis Dockter: Right, right.

107
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.610
Jeremy Smith: Like it really is. I'm

108
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.150
Jeremy Smith: I've spent most of my career like working

109
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:28.190
Jeremy Smith: like as a rails developer, you know, solo, or on very small teams, not usually running a team and doing almost everything myself.

110
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:42.545
Jeremy Smith: So I've like optimized myself professionally to do things on my own. This was a venture into like stepping out of that, and not just like doing the same thing. But in many ways like, I don't have the skills to

111
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:49.349
Jeremy Smith: delegate. Well, like I, I have not worked on those skills a lot. So this was a good experience of

112
00:12:49.520 --> 00:13:01.504
Jeremy Smith: stepping more into that and trying to delegate and but one of the one of the big challenges despite that like, even if you were really good at like building a team and like handing out responsibilities.

113
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.809
Jeremy Smith: I think that works really well when you know what the job is to do.

114
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.610
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

115
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:12.450
Jeremy Smith: But if you've never done the job and you haven't seen it done well, how do you even know what needs to be done?

116
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.090
Jeremy Smith: Responsive abilities.

117
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.629
Jeremy Smith: And so that was like, I guess I would push back a little on that and just say, like.

118
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.250
Jeremy Smith: you do need people in your corner, and you do need people who are willing to do stuff I don't know.

119
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.710
Jeremy Smith: I don't like.

120
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:37.070
Jeremy Smith: I'm sure they're like, I know, Adrian. He had a team, and they they all split up the work and found a way to make that work for me. It's like it was hard to know what I could hand off and know like.

121
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:58.863
Jeremy Smith: how? How will that have gone like? Did that go? Will that have gone the way I needed to? Will, I know, will I get the information back? Then I needed to make the next decision. That was just really challenging. And so I had great volunteer team. I probably didn't delegate very well to them. And I think I could do that better a second time. But

122
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:18.320
Jeremy Smith: it's still hard when I'm also kind of a control freak, and a perfectionist. And like the last thing I want to do is bring in people who are willing to give their time and attention, and and you know their free time, and then be like, Oh, that's not good enough, or I don't like what you did about that like. That's really hard to figure out, too, is like.

123
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.450
Jeremy Smith: How do you?

124
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.339
Jeremy Smith: How do you hit the quality level that you want?

125
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.049
Jeremy Smith: But not like

126
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:37.789
Jeremy Smith: not be a jerk to people that are just given their free time and like showing like when they didn't need to. So there's so many things about that that are just like really challenging, and I don't know exactly how to manage that.

127
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:56.880
Jeremy Smith: So but the volunteers were just a great team. We met up weekly and kind of talked about what we, what we were doing. I think I did the bulk of the work for for most things, but did hand off some things to them. But having the a team that was

128
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:04.769
Jeremy Smith: we had already spent time together before the event was really important, because the day of the event.

129
00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:19.964
Jeremy Smith: You really do need multiple people kind of in different areas. You need someone that's in charge of food. And Bev, you need someone that's in charge of registration. You need someone that's in charge of the speakers, making sure they have what they need. And you have someone in charge of AV

130
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:27.260
Jeremy Smith: All of that set up, you know, making sure that's working well and and maybe even just venue or something.

131
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:52.699
Jeremy Smith: And you can't do it all that day, and you don't want everyone just showing up and saying, shaking hands for the 1st time like, Hey, hello! It's nice to meet you. Yes, you're in charge over here. You really want to like, be have spent time with those people before? So I do think it's important to build a team. I do think it's valuable if you can delegate, but especially you need people that day, and I would recommend like hanging out with them like, go get beer like.

132
00:15:52.700 --> 00:16:12.809
Jeremy Smith: you know, have have a few meals together, do some activities together like, so that you know how to communicate well together. And are ready. So that that 1st day you're not like having difficulties communicating because you've never talked to each other. You don't know each other's personalities like if someone looks stressed, do they just always look that way, or.

133
00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:13.160
Travis Dockter: Hey!

134
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.310
Jeremy Smith: Are they communicating, you know, like, you need to know, like what's going on with with their personalities, and how they communicate

135
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.360
Jeremy Smith: stuff.

136
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:20.750
Travis Dockter: Cool.

137
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.396
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

138
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:29.559
Travis Dockter: Was there one thing that was hardest for you like? Do you think there's 1 part of

139
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.410
Travis Dockter: making a conference? That's the hardest part.

140
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.529
Jeremy Smith: The hardest part for me was dealing with people who were upset

141
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:45.129
Jeremy Smith: and I had a few situations like that. There weren't that many, but they stand out really clearly in my mind.

142
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:54.300
Jeremy Smith: and yeah, I I don't necessarily want to get into the details on that but

143
00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.870
Jeremy Smith: the thing about conferences is you have all these different people who

144
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.869
Jeremy Smith: and I think I mentioned this in the podcast.

145
00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:25.952
Jeremy Smith: All these different types of people that have like have expectations on you like. So you make deals with your vendors, and they have expectations for you. Then you're like selling tickets to attendees, so now they have expectations. You've invited speakers in. Now they have expectations. You've got some sponsorships now they have expectations.

146
00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:27.829
Jeremy Smith: and

147
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:36.976
Jeremy Smith: trying to manage all of those, and figure out what people's expectations are, and if they're reasonable, and then figuring out where you, if you fail at something,

148
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:47.253
Jeremy Smith: is really hard to manage. And then for me, I'm just like anxious about that kind of stuff. And then I just had a few situations where

149
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:54.109
Jeremy Smith: people got mad because they felt like I'd done something the wrong way, and that.

150
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:59.179
Travis Dockter: A certain expectation, and you didn't know that or didn't meet that. For some reason.

151
00:17:59.180 --> 00:17:59.680
Jeremy Smith: Yeah.

152
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.720
Travis Dockter: Gotcha.

153
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:14.849
Jeremy Smith: Yeah. And I think in each situation it did work out, but it was also in the moment like high anxiety for me, like just found like like I'd really messed up and not knowing what to do with myself.

154
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:34.033
Jeremy Smith: And that's again we're having someone like Mark, who was pretty steady and like, you know what? We're gonna be. Okay. You know that kind of person like not as phased by some of those things like really helped. But for me, that's like that is a that can be a really real emotional roller coaster.

155
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:34.940
Travis Dockter: Right.

156
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:46.079
Jeremy Smith: And I don't know that you can get around that. I think that's just that's just like the game, like I could probably have prepared everything, and something else could have happened or would have happened. It's like it feels like it's inevitable.

157
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.640
Jeremy Smith: And I need to like.

158
00:18:50.010 --> 00:19:00.810
Jeremy Smith: I think maybe in the past I would have looked at those negative things, and it would have painted everything as like, oh, I messed up those 2 things, you know, 2 or 3 things. It was terrible. And the reality is, that's not true. Like.

159
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.940
Jeremy Smith: there were 2 or 3 things that were really hard in the moment.

160
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.890
Jeremy Smith: They're not that big of a deal in the long term.

161
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.550
Travis Dockter: Convey.

162
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.590
Jeremy Smith: Takeaway was like over a hundred people had a really good time at this event.

163
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.049
Jeremy Smith: and that's what I should take away, not those like minor things.

164
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:29.009
Jeremy Smith: but that can be hard thing. I like just depending on your personality. How how you handle those kind of things like I hate messing up and messing up with clients or messing up on projects, whatever it is. I just hate that. And

165
00:19:29.484 --> 00:19:32.080
Jeremy Smith: especially when there's money involved, too, like that's.

166
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.410
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

167
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.559
Jeremy Smith: Makes it harder.

168
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.730
Travis Dockter: Yeah, I definitely get that definitely relate to that.

169
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:46.119
Travis Dockter: Okay, what's what was? Or

170
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:52.800
Travis Dockter: so I when I met you at Sin city ruby in 2023, I think.

171
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.095
Jeremy Smith: Okay,

172
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.079
Travis Dockter: You were a speaker there. Did you have some sort of like

173
00:19:57.768 --> 00:20:06.619
Travis Dockter: network that you had gotten from speaking that that helped a little bit like, what was your network like when you were starting this.

174
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.313
Jeremy Smith: Almost nonexistent.

175
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.569
Jeremy Smith: Okay, that's where I'm starting.

176
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.930
Jeremy Smith: It's really

177
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:24.810
Jeremy Smith: yeah. People assume if you're starting a conference that you've been around like, I guess. In a way, I've been around in the ruby rails community for a long time, but mostly as a lurker, you know, like

178
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.739
Jeremy Smith: going on in the community.

179
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:34.020
Jeremy Smith: I read a lot. I've been to southeast Ruby Jason Charn's conference a few times, and

180
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.169
Jeremy Smith: but I'd never been to a ruby cough. Never been to a railsconf.

181
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:48.030
Jeremy Smith: It was not a big conference attender. Had young kids, you know, like wasn't just wasn't leaving and going to conferences, you know, not spending a lot of money going to conferences and stuff and not.

182
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:58.010
Jeremy Smith: I'd spoken at a conference here in Greenville one time, but never at a Ruby or Rails conference. So 2022 at Ruby Conf Mini was the 1st time I'd spoken at a at a ruby event.

183
00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.780
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

184
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.040
Jeremy Smith: And then in 2023, like.

185
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:08.350
Jeremy Smith: yeah. The just hoping like for the 1st time, I guess. And then or sorry. Yeah. 2023.

186
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.150
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

187
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.539
Jeremy Smith: What's the timeline of Sin City? I guess.

188
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:19.369
Travis Dockter: Was it like in March? And then was your 1st Blue Ridge in like the in May?

189
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:27.450
Jeremy Smith: Yeah. Sin City was. Yeah. So I did speak at in 2024 at Sin City. That was a talk that I gave at friendly Rv. That was 8.

190
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.570
Travis Dockter: 2024 right.

191
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:35.450
Jeremy Smith: So in 2023. So yeah, starting to blur together. But yeah, like, I, I really did not have much network at all.

192
00:21:36.139 --> 00:21:41.943
Jeremy Smith: It was something that I was working actively, working on on improving

193
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:53.099
Jeremy Smith: Both on like through Twitter, but also by by being involved at conferences and stuff like that. But I was starting with kind of very little, I think.

194
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.440
Travis Dockter: No.

195
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.570
Jeremy Smith: Looking back now like I don't.

196
00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.083
Jeremy Smith: That may have been somewhat of an anomaly, because I think

197
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:08.918
Jeremy Smith: One impact of Covid was that everyone came back and had sort of a level of attention to community things.

198
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.420
Jeremy Smith: That was not typical.

199
00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.719
Travis Dockter: All right.

200
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:20.279
Jeremy Smith: And so it was like I just happened to hit, partly hit that at the right time, just like be in the right place at the right time, when

201
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:26.050
Jeremy Smith: lots of people were trying to get back and being really intentional about reconnecting, and just happened to like I

202
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:45.049
Jeremy Smith: I I was also thinking that, too. But I think I got lucky in some ways to make friends with a bunch of people that ended up really helping me, you know, along the way. But running a conference is a good way of building a network, too, like I can say that like you

203
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:56.499
Jeremy Smith: you play the host to a bunch of people that you look up to, or people that you know about, or people that you know, like have been in the community a long time, and

204
00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:10.180
Jeremy Smith: that means that they all have an experience with you now that matters to them. And it's not like I got to spend time with every single attendee, but I probably got to meet most of them. And now that something's that's another thing I noticed about

205
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:31.489
Jeremy Smith: Sin City especially, but also rail. Sas was, you know, you have someone like Jason or someone like Andrew putting on an event. And now I have like something that they've done for me that's really special. And I now care about them as people even more than I did before, even more than the content. Maybe, that I got from them previously, like

206
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:48.589
Jeremy Smith: being able to show up to an event that's hosted. It's it's almost like a house party where, you know, like you've been to somebody's house, and they, you know, they served you and, like entertained you. And and you have. You had this really good experience because of them. And that is.

207
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:54.799
Jeremy Smith: it's kind of a valuable way of building a network, you know, like that helps. Yeah.

208
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.330
Travis Dockter: How many people were at. How big was your first.st

209
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.489
Jeremy Smith: It was.

210
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:06.959
Jeremy Smith: I think, in total we had maybe 100 1,020 something in that range that include that included, like.

211
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:11.522
Jeremy Smith: you know the attendees, the speakers. All the volunteers.

212
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.210
Travis Dockter: You said a hundred 10, a hundred 20.

213
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.049
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, something like that. Yeah.

214
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:27.559
Travis Dockter: And how did you? How did you market like? Did you have a marketing strategy? Was there anything that like really worked well, and anything that was useless, and you wouldn't do again

215
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.690
Travis Dockter: anything that stood out there.

216
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:37.810
Jeremy Smith: I think marketing is often underappreciated by developers especially, and

217
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:43.309
Jeremy Smith: I knew that going in like that, I had my work cut out for me there and then. I had to push that

218
00:24:44.186 --> 00:24:45.620
Jeremy Smith: both because

219
00:24:45.770 --> 00:25:06.819
Jeremy Smith: I failed at building my own products around marketing a lot but also because putting on something new like this like I just, I needed to go from 0 to 60, you know, like, in 5 months I needed to find a way to hit my numbers and sell tickets. And how would people know if I didn't do like if I like? There was no way they were just gonna

220
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.740
Jeremy Smith: magically find out.

221
00:25:09.036 --> 00:25:09.629
Travis Dockter: Fine. Yeah.

222
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:10.970
Jeremy Smith: Like if I just trusted that

223
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:32.999
Jeremy Smith: people went to rubyconferences.org, we're gonna happen to see it. And like, certainly some people. But that's a very small number, you know, like it's that's not gonna be enough. So I was pulling out all the tricks that I that I knew and I've done marketing efforts like, for you know, I built used to build marketing landing pages. I used to help do marketing for various companies clients that I had. But I

224
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:46.480
Jeremy Smith: So I was using whatever tactics I I could think of. But I didn't know what would work for. Sure, I think partly I got lucky because of the timing that I mentioned like people. Suddenly there was a surge of interest, and I was able to ride that wave a little bit.

225
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:59.498
Jeremy Smith: I think there is a benefit to novelty. People like a new thing, people like seeing something new coming online. And and that is a big benefit.

226
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:12.995
Jeremy Smith: so. But then, also, like I knew, I needed to convey a level of quality through the stuff I put out as best I could. So that meant spending a lot of time building the the marketing site.

227
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.180
Jeremy Smith: doing like.

228
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.310
Jeremy Smith: you know, doing a lot of social media stuff as much as I could think. I made like

229
00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:33.710
Jeremy Smith: trailer Video, like where I drove around. I had my wife drive around Asheville. I was taking, you know, taking video with my phone and like various places and put it together like to make a video trailer, just like because I needed, I needed stuff. I needed.

230
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.300
Travis Dockter: Putting stuff together.

231
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.170
Jeremy Smith: Together and put things out there.

232
00:26:36.677 --> 00:26:41.202
Jeremy Smith: That would get people interested. I built like a city guide of

233
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:48.800
Jeremy Smith: all my favorite places to go or eat, or drink, or whatever it was. So people, when they came to town would know what to.

234
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.450
Jeremy Smith: You know what to experience, what they would want to get cause I knew like

235
00:26:52.670 --> 00:27:22.233
Jeremy Smith: that. Partly there was a benefit of the destination like it's not just some random town somewhere that no one wants to hang out in. And you just like in this you know, in like a conference hall, and then go back to your hotel like people want to come here and experience it. So I want to make sure it was able to check all the boxes on that for people, too, and that's a way to get people to come, because I know that happens like people wanted to visit. And so it was like, it was like, even easier for them to buy a ticket.

236
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.100
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

237
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.821
Jeremy Smith: So all, all of those things.

238
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.129
Jeremy Smith: I'm trying to think what else?

239
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:39.429
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, we I mean, we did some email as well like we, we definitely had an email list. And we're sending out things that way.

240
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:47.230
Jeremy Smith: I'm trying to think if there's any other major strategy, not I can't think of any now. I would go like if I was

241
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:57.169
Jeremy Smith: In some ways it'd be easier, you know, being able to have like something established already. It might be easier to come out the second wave, but

242
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:58.420
Travis Dockter: Go ahead!

243
00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:07.099
Jeremy Smith: I might reach out more to other conferences. I've seen conferences do this like conferences supporting each other like, Hey.

244
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:07.670
Travis Dockter: Oh, yeah.

245
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:14.700
Jeremy Smith: Just want to like highlight. This actually this oh, I I totally forgot about this. I wonder if I go to?

246
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.160
Jeremy Smith: Went to?

247
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.740
Jeremy Smith: I think it was

248
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:26.450
Jeremy Smith: Railsconf, Atlanta, no, where. I can't remember the conference, but I went to a conference where I

249
00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:39.660
Jeremy Smith: made these postcards mailers that had like look. They look like a mailer that had all the details about Blue Ridge. I put a discount code on it, and then I like got these custom stickers made with the the logo

250
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.715
Jeremy Smith: and

251
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:49.190
Jeremy Smith: and I like attached it with like the this little sticky thing like. So it like kind of like, sat out in front of the

252
00:28:49.832 --> 00:29:00.329
Jeremy Smith: of the card. And then people had something to put on their computer later. And people really seem to like that. So like I would lay those out in the at tables that must have been rails. Comp. Can't remember

253
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:08.799
Jeremy Smith: forgetting what the conference was, but all I was just pulling out all the tricks like that. To try to get people to

254
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:26.120
Jeremy Smith: check it out or look at it. Oh! And then, as soon as like with the other thing about like you're trying to figure out things to share or things that entice people like. One is the the place they're going like, what? What's the space going to be like? What is before you even know who the speakers are? What am I going to experience in this place.

255
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:47.859
Jeremy Smith: So it's like figuring out like, Oh, there's cool, you know, cool breweries in this town, and there's really good restaurants, and the venue looks really nice right? And then it's like, then you do the Cfp, and then you get this. Then you announced speakers, and then they're like, Oh, well, on top of that like, I want to hear from this person this person, this but that'd be really oh, I'd like the sound of that talk. So you're trying to hype that as well. And then

256
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.080
Jeremy Smith: I mean, sometimes people even do like.

257
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.780
Jeremy Smith: you know, sharing the the attendees that are going to be there as well. So

258
00:29:54.182 --> 00:30:15.419
Jeremy Smith: you're doing all those things to kind of like check all the boxes of the reasons people come to conferences, which is a combination of things. It's like I want to be, you know, experience a new place. I want to learn new things I want to hear from these speakers, or, you know, here on these topics. I wanna hang out with this these kind of people. I want to do these kind of activities. So.

259
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:26.510
Jeremy Smith: and every and people come for different reasons. But you're trying to do as many of like show as many of those things as possible to kind of entice people like, you're going to get this and this. You're going to enjoy this and this as much as possible.

260
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.950
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

261
00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:34.030
Travis Dockter: Did you do anything special to another

262
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:42.500
Travis Dockter: thing that I foresee being difficult because I don't have a network is getting speakers to come to this, do you? Did you do anything special to get speakers.

263
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.120
Jeremy Smith: That. Actually, I don't know how much. This was

264
00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:54.189
Jeremy Smith: a post Covid thing, but that actually was not hard. We ended up having like 55 talk proposals.

265
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.170
Travis Dockter: Oh, nice!

266
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.370
Jeremy Smith: And I only had 10 slots. I had 2 days.

267
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.768
Jeremy Smith: 5 talks a day.

268
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:07.148
Jeremy Smith: So it was 30 min talk 30 min break, 30 min talk 30 min. That was kind of like I saw that stole that from Jason.

269
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:08.100
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

270
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.680
Jeremy Smith: Because I just love that.

271
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.724
Jeremy Smith: So that was just not hard.

272
00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:14.830
Travis Dockter: Cool.

273
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:21.569
Jeremy Smith: It was hard to decide, but it was not hard to get people. Now I've heard other conferences had have had fewer

274
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.509
Jeremy Smith: talk, so again. It might be an anomaly I don't know, but

275
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.579
Jeremy Smith: still, even at half that you you can get 10 talks, I think.

276
00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:40.330
Jeremy Smith: And I think you can also ask people. I think that was something I didn't realize that I could do is like

277
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:49.019
Jeremy Smith: you can do a mix of you. You can do whatever you want like. That's the thing like you can be like Andy Kroll, who, I think, handpicks almost everybody.

278
00:31:49.350 --> 00:32:10.720
Jeremy Smith: You can do a rails Comp. Style like, we have a very specific way that we do like the double blind, or, you know, like talk, proposal, review, or whatever you like. You can have a whole process that you show people, or you cannot do that too. And people will have some expectations around that, like some people will be like, why don't you do it this way? That's not fair like.

279
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:20.430
Jeremy Smith: It's your conference. You like people you're allowed to like. Pick how you want to do it. I think there are ways to do it better than others like, you know, ways to sort of

280
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:35.669
Jeremy Smith: respect some traditions, or, you know, community values. But like, if you kind of express your values about about that, like what you're trying to do and and and then find a way to honor that through Cfp process. I think you can. You can make that work. But ultimately it is your call on that.

281
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:51.753
Jeremy Smith: And I, yeah, so I think you can. Also you can do. Cfp. You can also reach out to people and say, Would you be willing? I'd love to hear you. I loved hearing this talk. Would you come, you know, deliver here, love that so that that is manageable. Part of that, too, is like

282
00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:59.410
Jeremy Smith: It may be. I know. I knew I had talked to several organizers and said, like, what do you do about like

283
00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:11.190
Jeremy Smith: compensation for speakers? And what I heard a few times was like, okay, around $500 for us ruby conferences, regional ruby conferences. Okay.

284
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:17.020
Jeremy Smith: I think I can manage that. That was another thing that was in my head like, okay, if I've got a hard cost on the venue.

285
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:31.830
Jeremy Smith: it's 7 grand. I gotta put 3,500 down to begin with, and then I've got 10 speakers, $500 each. That's 5 grand. There. I don't know if I can pull off video, but like I'm starting to put in these fixed costs, you know, and then, building a budget out of that and new

286
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.860
Jeremy Smith: based on that, I could work back into how many tickets I'd have to sell to break even.

287
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:44.620
Travis Dockter: Gotcha. Yeah. So speaking of money, the the big 3 things right now in my mind

288
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:54.129
Travis Dockter: are getting selling tickets via, you know, marketing, getting speakers to come and getting sponsors. So

289
00:33:54.600 --> 00:34:00.889
Travis Dockter: how was it for you getting sponsors that 1st year? Yeah, I didn't pick.

290
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.330
Jeremy Smith: This was, yeah, this was a

291
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.820
Jeremy Smith: again. I probably got lucky and cause I didn't have a network, and I didn't know who to reach out to.

292
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.937
Jeremy Smith: And I didn't know some of the some of the ways companies work.

293
00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:22.929
Jeremy Smith: a lot of times they've decided budgets for Spot like for Conference sponsorships

294
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:44.929
Jeremy Smith: months back, or the previous year, they allocate funds. And so, even if you get a sympathetic ear, you may not. You may have been too late. So some of that is around the planning and the timing, and I think for a 1st time conference is probably hard to pull off, because you're kind of an anomaly, and

295
00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:52.930
Jeremy Smith: that's 1 of the things that I really appreciated. That 1st time we had 3 sponsors and they were all

296
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.212
Jeremy Smith: really trusting me.

297
00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:01.380
Jeremy Smith: to put something on that that worked that didn't flop. Because I think that can happen, you know, like you could

298
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:09.720
Jeremy Smith: not do things well, and then those people's names are on it. You know those companies are on it that that would suck for them.

299
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:14.889
Jeremy Smith: So I really appreciated the the trust that they gave me. It was mostly

300
00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:25.709
Jeremy Smith: he luck, or I think one had reached out to us like, Hey, Hey, we'd love to sponsor you. And I thought like, Wow, that's

301
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:34.703
Jeremy Smith: super generous. I just met them like, you know, a few months ago, and would not have guessed that. And another one

302
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:41.744
Jeremy Smith: trying to think another big one that how did that sponsorship happen? It might have been through

303
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.879
Jeremy Smith: a mutual connection or something. It helps to have

304
00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.459
Jeremy Smith: direct connections to sponsorships. I think the 1st time, especially.

305
00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:49.840
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

306
00:35:50.207 --> 00:35:56.089
Jeremy Smith: People that you know. That's probably where network matters even more is the sponsorships, because attendees

307
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.930
Jeremy Smith: don't necessarily need a personal relationship with you to show up

308
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:08.939
Jeremy Smith: if they can trust that. The speakers look good, and it seems like legit, although I did have. I did have a guy that was like is this Conference legit?

309
00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:20.009
Jeremy Smith: Because I was using my stripe account for registration, and it was under my Llc. Which was not Blue Ridge Ruby, because I didn't set up a you know, like a separate like Llc.

310
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:20.670
Travis Dockter: Okay. Yeah.

311
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:31.659
Jeremy Smith: Conference, and he saw, like the stripe, you know, on stripe, like you get to the checkout page, and it shows like your the company like, not like product, or whatever that you're selling. And he's like, is this actually like.

312
00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.949
Travis Dockter: Are you just siphoning this money off and not

313
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:38.240
Travis Dockter: yeah, exactly. So like you. You do have to deal with like.

314
00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:45.690
Jeremy Smith: That kind of situation, because PE people legitimately don't know you from like you're not a ruby cough or rails cough, or whatever like

315
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.250
Jeremy Smith: right.

316
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.719
Jeremy Smith: People don't know who you are.

317
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.260
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

318
00:36:49.190 --> 00:37:03.175
Jeremy Smith: and it. But it it worked out. And it, yeah. So the bigger, bigger thing on the sponsorships, I think it helps to have those personal connections. One of the things one of the best pieces of advice I got from another organizer, he said. Like, especially when you're starting out.

319
00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:16.570
Jeremy Smith: every. Your your brand, or the conference itself is not what you're selling. You're selling you to sponsorships, particularly sponsors, but also attendees and speakers.

320
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:31.430
Jeremy Smith: You have to convince them that you are going to pull this off. Not that your Blue Ridge ruby thing. They don't know that they've never heard you just made that up right? So it's you. It's you saying I'm going to be the one respond. I'm going to be on the hook

321
00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:44.079
Jeremy Smith: to make sure that this event goes. Well, you know, I'm going to be the one that's responsible I'm gonna want. I'm the one that's looking you in the eye, saying I'm going to do everything in my power to make this a really great event that you're going to be happy with. What do you need from me?

322
00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:57.960
Jeremy Smith: What can make this successful for you, and they're making an agreement with you, and that really helps clarify for me like the approach that I needed to take to win people's trust cause. That's what you're doing is building trust with everybody like.

323
00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.390
Travis Dockter: Right.

324
00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:04.610
Jeremy Smith: Speakers. Can they trust you? Attendees? Can they trust you? Vendors? Can they trust you sponsors? Can they trust you?

325
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.490
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

326
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:06.880
Jeremy Smith: Yeah.

327
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:15.850
Travis Dockter: It's good advice, because I was thinking of it, of like from the point of like, how do I convince these people that

328
00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:29.290
Travis Dockter: this is going to be a conference worth sponsoring or worth attending, or whatever, because I have no following. I have no experience in doing this, so everybody's taking a huge risk on you.

329
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:45.560
Travis Dockter: but that does help. Instead of going to people and saying like, Look, there's gonna you know, I'm I'm hoping to sell this many tickets. And you know, it's gonna be like this kind of demographic. So you'll really get your money's worth because you're gonna get in front of these people.

330
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:51.530
Travis Dockter: It's pro. It's probably better to to sell yourself, because that's

331
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:58.350
Travis Dockter: probably the more valuable thing in this situation. It's the only thing of value that you have really.

332
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:04.830
Jeremy Smith: You don't. You don't have any hard numbers to show them. Here's what we did in the past. Here's what we're going to do. Here's our project, you know.

333
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.270
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

334
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:06.790
Jeremy Smith: Oh, no, yeah. So

335
00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:12.220
Jeremy Smith: it is people having to trust you. And so you have to find sponsors that are.

336
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:18.049
Jeremy Smith: or hope that sponsors come to you that will embrace that, too, will be.

337
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.620
Travis Dockter: Right.

338
00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:38.853
Jeremy Smith: And I don't think most sponsors are like that, you know, for for good reasons. Cause they're they've got certain number, you know, certain amount of dollars they can do spend, and they've got to make bets on where you know. Place those bets on the conferences that are gonna make the most sense for them. And so when they do come to a brand new conference, that's just a real sign of trust. And

339
00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:39.425
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

340
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:47.989
Jeremy Smith: And I probably wouldn't rely too much on that. I think it's worth having the conversations worth spending time on and connecting with people, but

341
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.809
Jeremy Smith: maybe not counting on it as much.

342
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.740
Jeremy Smith: For that 1st time, and I think

343
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.860
Jeremy Smith: if you especially if you can

344
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:04.960
Jeremy Smith: maybe focus more on sale on sale. Attendee tickets. but in in my case, like.

345
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.580
Jeremy Smith: I'm looking at the numbers again. Here it was like.

346
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:19.010
Jeremy Smith: yeah, like 20,000 in tickets and 10,000 in sponsorship.

347
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:23.390
Travis Dockter: Okay, so 1, 3, rd 2 thirds. And did you break even.

348
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.129
Jeremy Smith: I did. Yeah, I had

349
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.860
Jeremy Smith: The way I approached it was I had a base

350
00:40:33.523 --> 00:40:54.850
Jeremy Smith: budget that I knew I had to hit, make, or break. It was like, I've got these hard costs. We're doing this conference. That means I need to sell this many tickets. I don't know it might have been like, I need to sell 65 tickets or something like that. And we can have the bare minimum conference, you know, like, got the venue we've got like

351
00:40:56.370 --> 00:41:02.869
Jeremy Smith: you know, we've got some minimal drinks and snacks we've got like, I'm paying the speaker honorarium

352
00:41:03.498 --> 00:41:19.090
Jeremy Smith: and then I had like, okay, if I surpass that, then I'll just spend more. I'll do t-shirts. I'll do better drinks and snacks. I'll make banners, I'll you know like do prizes. We'll do like giveaways, and I'll have like local, you know.

353
00:41:19.776 --> 00:41:30.163
Jeremy Smith: souvenirs that I can give away as prizes and stuff like that. And so I was able to do all of it thankfully, and so broke even. It was about 30,000 total

354
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.359
Jeremy Smith: for all of it.

355
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.660
Travis Dockter: Nice.

356
00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:54.059
Jeremy Smith: But yeah, you you can do it cheaper by sort of setting, almost like stretch goals. And and I let people know that like, don't know if video is gonna happen because people will ask a lot of common questions like, Are you providing meals? Are you doing video? Are you doing that, you know. Like, are you doing a hotel? Block rate?

357
00:41:54.230 --> 00:42:05.099
Jeremy Smith: I would say 2 things right now that I'm really happy. I didn't do one was I didn't do catered meals, and I didn't do hotel block rate, and I would recommend that to every 1st time conference, and maybe for

358
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:08.749
Jeremy Smith: most conferences. I just don't think like you're just.

359
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.310
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

360
00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:33.244
Jeremy Smith: On the hook on the hotel block rate. I think I mentioned that before, but also food is really hard. I've noticed this like, it's hard to get this right. People get really crabby about like the food situation. So if you have an option to have a conference in a place where people can walk out, and then 5 or 10 min be at a restaurant sitting down, eating, and then they come back, and you just make a nice long lunch break for people.

361
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:47.090
Jeremy Smith: that's way better. And then people can get what they want, and they don't have to come to you saying like, why didn't you have this on the menu? Or, yeah, this was cold by the time we got there through there in line. And you know it's just a whole class of issues. You don't have to deal with.

362
00:42:47.805 --> 00:42:50.050
Travis Dockter: Yep, yeah.

363
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.185
Travis Dockter: Okay,

364
00:42:53.030 --> 00:43:05.307
Travis Dockter: we talked about all the details. Now, I want to get like a little bit more, maybe philosophical or just more about like experience.

365
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:27.310
Travis Dockter: Was there anything that you did at Blue Ridge Ruby that maybe at the time you like? It was something small that you just kind of threw in there, and it had an unexpected impact, like people were coming up to you afterwards. They're like, I love this part, and you're like, well, I didn't think that anyone would care about that. Was there anything like that?

366
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:28.723
Jeremy Smith: Yes, yeah.

367
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.507
Jeremy Smith: One of the things that really mattered to me about this event was,

368
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:44.229
Jeremy Smith: There are rare times that you get a lot of people in a community together.

369
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:50.860
Jeremy Smith: It's a it's a rare time for people to have face to face, interaction in build

370
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:58.890
Jeremy Smith: health and deeper connection together, and I don't think that happens necessarily through technical content.

371
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:03.680
Jeremy Smith: You need the technical content, because that's what we're all like.

372
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:11.400
Jeremy Smith: That's that's the affinity that draws us together. But that's not how you build relationships. And on the

373
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:17.129
Jeremy Smith: 1st day I gave like an intro that people really liked where I talked a lot about

374
00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:27.568
Jeremy Smith: what I've what I've learned about ecosystem health, and how that the implications for that in the ruby community. But on the second day after, like

375
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.300
Jeremy Smith: like right before the 1st speaker, I had like a

376
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:41.199
Jeremy Smith: a 20 to 30 min time slot that I didn't know what to do with, and leading up to the conference. I was like, I don't know what to do with this thing, this weird

377
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:49.580
Jeremy Smith: spot and time like. And so I kept thinking about it. And and a couple of days before I had this idea that made me like

378
00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.309
Jeremy Smith: interested, but also nervous. And

379
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.661
Jeremy Smith: I decided to go for it. And that day I got up and said, like

380
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:03.560
Jeremy Smith: trying to put myself back in the frame to remember how I said it. But basically, like

381
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.990
Jeremy Smith: we've had a few years where?

382
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:14.279
Jeremy Smith: It's been really tough in the world and in the ruby community for a number of different reasons.

383
00:45:15.262 --> 00:45:20.347
Jeremy Smith: But 1 1 thing that I think helps communities grow and

384
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:27.879
Jeremy Smith: strengthen is by sharing what we're grateful for and things that have impacted us positively.

385
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:39.040
Jeremy Smith: And so I said, like, I want to give everyone a chance to like, share what they've gotten from people in the ruby community, from companies, things that have happened for them that have been really positive.

386
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:44.720
Jeremy Smith: And let me start like I named a couple like I talked about the influence of

387
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.240
Jeremy Smith: thought Bot and and

388
00:45:48.090 --> 00:46:08.599
Jeremy Smith: in my own growth trajectory, all the content that I learned back in the day from their blog and how that shaped a lot of what I did and what I cared about even running a solo agency like looking at them, and like the things they did working as consultancy and they had just hit their 20th anniversary.

389
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:19.760
Jeremy Smith: And then I also mentioned, like, we just started the Indie rails podcast and even though he was not a Rubius, like our editor, had been so encouraging, getting off the ground, and like that mattered to me.

390
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:23.839
Jeremy Smith: And then, when I finish that, I waited to see like

391
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:29.859
Jeremy Smith: if anybody would want to share, and then hand start going up around this room.

392
00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.040
Jeremy Smith: And so I'm

393
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:39.919
Jeremy Smith: passing the mic to all these people who are just sharing like this person got me into Ruby, and and people be like, I know that guy, you know, like

394
00:46:40.117 --> 00:46:40.710
Jeremy Smith: that's pretty good

395
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:49.800
Jeremy Smith: like this helped me personally help me get a job. And I really valued this thing, and it just went on and on and on, and probably 2030 min I had to stop it.

396
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:50.480
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

397
00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.759
Jeremy Smith: Yeah time we're done like I've got tears in my eyes like this is like

398
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:58.710
Jeremy Smith: one of the most magical things that I'd ever experienced and like, how would you?

399
00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:06.969
Jeremy Smith: You couldn't get that online. You can't get that at a big conference. It was like, only at a small conference. Could you have an experience like that.

400
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:15.689
Jeremy Smith: But it was like deeply impactful for me. And it seemed like for everybody else, too. And so I just like I love that.

401
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.780
Travis Dockter: Yeah, that sounds amazing. I really.

402
00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.429
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, it's just like, a memory I cherish. Yeah.

403
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:22.800
Travis Dockter: Awesome.

404
00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:24.550
Travis Dockter: That's really cool.

405
00:47:25.274 --> 00:47:34.960
Travis Dockter: Okay, do you? Have a favorite conference that you've been to, or favorite conference experience at somebody else's conference.

406
00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:45.835
Jeremy Smith: I've enjoyed almost every conference I've gone to. When I finally unlocked that, I'm there to make friends and

407
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.979
Jeremy Smith: and and connect with people, and not there, because I need to

408
00:47:50.570 --> 00:48:10.660
Jeremy Smith: get a sale, or, you know, find a new client, or learn a new time, you know. Learn it when I could like, disconnect the economic benefit that I need the Roi that I needed to get, you know, like from the experience and could relax into, I love these people. I love this place. I wanna be around these folks and

409
00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:17.670
Jeremy Smith: so I've I've really enjoyed conferences since figuring that piece out for myself, but

410
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:27.816
Jeremy Smith: maybe one that stands out right now is going to friendly Rb, in Bucharest, and I got to speak there. But

411
00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:34.189
Jeremy Smith: Adrian is is a fantastic host. For conferences. It was his 1st time as well.

412
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:37.950
Jeremy Smith: I have really enjoyed

413
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:44.082
Jeremy Smith: I I never traveled very much, but it's been something on my that I've really wanted to

414
00:48:44.600 --> 00:49:10.080
Jeremy Smith: lately, and going there and meeting a bunch of European rubies from all over. So they're not like. But they're all coming there, and they have to all speak English, because that's this one shared language. But I'm getting to like experience being with like the Germans and the the Polish people and the people from Spain, and, like you, just kind of like getting the vibe of like, and the and the people from Romania there, too, like, Oh, these people are like, here's what they're like.

415
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.590
Travis Dockter: This is a global thing. It's not just the.

416
00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:40.460
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, yeah. And we're all together at this little conference. But the day after the conference, Adrian, took us, we all met at the train station in the morning we took a 2 h train ride up into the Transylvanian Mountains, and we spent all day hiking. We visited a really cool castle. We hiked to this mountain peak. We came down into the mountain town after that, and they were having a festival that night, and we ate street food. It was a magical day.

417
00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.160
Travis Dockter: Wow!

418
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:52.800
Jeremy Smith: It was like I spent all day walking and talking with 20 to 30 Rubius, and we're all like together doing these. We had things that we were doing. But we're just walking and talking

419
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:57.736
Jeremy Smith: about technical things, about our lives like it was just a fantastic experience.

420
00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.060
Travis Dockter: That was the 1st that was like pre to the conference. The 1st day.

421
00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.900
Jeremy Smith: This was the the day after the conference.

422
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.360
Travis Dockter: Oh, the day after. Okay, gotcha.

423
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.360
Jeremy Smith: And that works really well, because you've spent.

424
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.819
Travis Dockter: And everybody kind of knows each other.

425
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:33.171
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, you've got topics. You've you've had a few chances to go out to, you know, lunch and dinner, together with various group members. But then, that last day, after the you know, after the technical talks are done, you're relaxing and enjoying each other, and like that's when it really the free, flowing conversation happens, I feel like, and and the chance to really solidify friendships.

426
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.290
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

427
00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.640
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, that was that was really special.

428
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.800
Travis Dockter: Yeah, I like that one, too.

429
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.520
Travis Dockter: Okay, cool.

430
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:48.909
Travis Dockter: Trying to. Yeah. I'm I'm like trying to find ideas to to steal from other conferences.

431
00:50:48.910 --> 00:51:13.820
Jeremy Smith: Well, I did something like this at Blue Ridge the day after the conference. Can't remember why I had this idea, but I knew, like for me that the relationships was really what mattered like. Once I'd fit that once I'd hit that, it really helped me unlock like why, conferences are valuable what you can get out of a conference rather than just watching the talks on Youtube if you can. Just if it's all about the technical talks you need them. But if I can just watch them on Youtube and probably

432
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:28.869
Jeremy Smith: retain the information better, then conferences are about something else. They're about like getting these people together and helping strengthen the bonds between people, which means creating opportunities for people to connect around meals around content.

433
00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:46.060
Jeremy Smith: And anything else that you can think of that will facilitate that. And a lot of people a lot of us are just. We're introverts. So we don't naturally just start networking and talking and like, Hey, everybody, let's what if we went down the street and went here and did? Let's go to this cool Arcade Museum together like

434
00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:56.860
Jeremy Smith: you have to. You have to make those things happen for people because they don't. Naturally, most people don't naturally take leadership to be like, I'm gonna bring this group of people. And we're gonna go do this

435
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:58.850
Jeremy Smith: so creating that

436
00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:19.439
Jeremy Smith: ahead of time creating structures for that, that is the kind of stuff that ends up being gold, I think. And so the day after the conference at Blue Ridge I gave people the options of going on a hike into the off of the Blue Ridge Parkway into the mountains of western North Carolina. Really beautiful. They could visit Biltmore, which is kind of like a

437
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:41.759
Jeremy Smith: America's closest thing to a castle, I guess, built by the Vanderbilt family and out of outside of Asheville, and nobody ended up picking that one. It's funny because I love that place. But then the thing that every like most people picked was, I was like we should do tubing. There's a river that runs right down through through Asheville, and this is such a like Southern. You know us thing to do like.

438
00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:44.151
Jeremy Smith: Dubing on the river, and

439
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:48.219
Jeremy Smith: That ended up being great. We had like a bunch of people, and we

440
00:52:48.940 --> 00:53:05.190
Jeremy Smith: the I was able to organize it so that the they took. You know they use this like old school buses to do tubing like. I don't know if they do that where you are but a lot of times around here they'll like, take old decommissioned school buses, and that's how like all the people get on the school bus. They drive you upriver.

441
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:12.806
Jeremy Smith: and then, like you float down to the headquarters or whatever. So they picked us up from the hotel in in the old school bus.

442
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.040
Jeremy Smith: It took us

443
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:34.899
Jeremy Smith: down to the river got us all outfitted and like nice quality tubes, you know, like with the bottom on it, and clips like we could all clip to each other. I had all the extra snacks from the conference that I brought with me, and a cooler, and then we got on the river, and like we'd be like, Hey, can you pass me? And you know one of the extra beers like, pass that down, and just like down the chain, you know, like

444
00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:35.519
Jeremy Smith: we're just like

445
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:44.329
Jeremy Smith: 2 or 3 h, just like hanging out on this river, talking together like having a good time it was. It was awesome. It was another one of those things like.

446
00:53:44.660 --> 00:54:00.070
Jeremy Smith: it's a thing that you don't normally do. Most people would not have thought to do like, but having created the structure for it, a bunch of people, all they had to do was say yes, and pay like 10 bucks, or 15 bucks, or whatever it was easy. And then we had a great time together, and it was just

447
00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:08.048
Jeremy Smith: getting getting something like that where you. It's a thing that allows for more conversation and more interaction.

448
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:09.919
Jeremy Smith: it's just great.

449
00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:13.609
Jeremy Smith: So yeah, I would totally do that kind of stuff again.

450
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.790
Travis Dockter: Awesome.

451
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:24.740
Travis Dockter: Okay? Well, we're coming up on an hour here. I feel like I have so many more questions. But maybe we can save it for another time.

452
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.300
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, you're welcome.

453
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.070
Travis Dockter: Anytime.

454
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:42.669
Travis Dockter: Yeah, man, thank you so much for taking the time. I definitely got a lot of good stuff out of this. I'm have to watch it again and take take some notes. But yeah, are you? Are you going to rails? Comp. This year?

455
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:49.029
Jeremy Smith: I was planning. No, it's possible that I might be able to go. We'll see.

456
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.440
Travis Dockter: Okay.

457
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.911
Jeremy Smith: So I've been really bummed about it for months like can't believe I'm missing this

458
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.806
Jeremy Smith: But there's a possibility that I could go so we'll we'll see.

459
00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.740
Travis Dockter: Okay. Cool.

460
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:03.040
Jeremy Smith: I've had to come back a little bit on conferences this year, like I went all out last year, especially.

461
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.070
Travis Dockter: Right.

462
00:55:04.346 --> 00:55:06.279
Jeremy Smith: It is expensive, like it is like.

463
00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:06.640
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

464
00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.279
Jeremy Smith: Go to a lot, and I have been going to a lot

465
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:09.950
Travis Dockter: Yeah, his.

466
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:20.449
Jeremy Smith: It's been one of the most rewarding parts of my life. But it's also one of those things is like when I've had to cut expenses or something that's like one thing, that sort of feels somewhat optional, you know.

467
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:22.150
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, I understand.

468
00:55:22.448 --> 00:55:31.650
Jeremy Smith: Yeah, so hopefully, that's temporary. And hopefully, I can make it to rails cough. I do hope to make this something else this year. After that, too, probably more into the fall, so.

469
00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:37.920
Travis Dockter: Cool. Yeah. Well, let me know if you're going to rails. Comp, I'll I'll be there.

470
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.180
Travis Dockter: Yeah. And and yeah, thank you again for your time, and we'll be in touch.

471
00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.369
Jeremy Smith: Thanks for having me. Travis.

472
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:46.380
Travis Dockter: Alrighty! Thanks, man, take care!

473
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:46.929
Jeremy Smith: See you.
