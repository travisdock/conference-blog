1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.990
Travis Dockter: Okay, cool.

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:15.719
Travis Dockter: Well, welcome to what I've been calling my unofficial, unprofessional interviews of conference organizers.

3
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:25.009
Travis Dockter: so a little bit of context, I decided that I'm going to

4
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.409
Travis Dockter: organize my own rails conference and I wanted to reach out to

5
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.159
Travis Dockter: a bunch of other conference organizers and just try to

6
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.577
Travis Dockter: soak up their knowledge, get their experience.

7
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:50.289
Travis Dockter: ask them all kinds of questions about how they did what they did, and I know that you organized

8
00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:02.770
Travis Dockter: southeast ruby a couple times, and you actually wrote a really awesome blog post after the 1st one

9
00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:07.553
Travis Dockter: called organizing my 1st conference southeast ruby

10
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:22.020
Travis Dockter: and I also, like I listened to. I think you did a podcast with Jason sweat on like organizing ruby conferences. So I think I'll skip over the kind of the

11
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.860
Travis Dockter: the. You know the whole story of you organizing that.

12
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.680
Travis Dockter: But I want to dive a little bit deeper. To to kind of

13
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:45.730
Travis Dockter: get a little bit deeper than maybe what that blog post was so just to clarify though it was, was it that 1st one? Was it a 2 day conference or a 1 day conference.

14
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.849
Jason Charnes: It was 2 day. I think all of them were 2 day.

15
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.827
Travis Dockter: There were 2 days. Okay, and you got

16
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:06.719
Travis Dockter: how many? How many speakers did you have? I think it was like 4 keynote, and then 10 other 2. Did you have like 14 speakers in 2 days?

17
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.249
Jason Charnes: Roughly. Yeah, it alternated.

18
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.469
Jason Charnes: I want to say it probably alternates some each year. The last year we added some workshops in

19
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.240
Travis Dockter: Okay. Cool.

20
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.300
Jason Charnes: But yeah.

21
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.270
Travis Dockter: Workshops.

22
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.320
Jason Charnes: Do? What.

23
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.849
Travis Dockter: What were the workshops.

24
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.559
Jason Charnes: Let's see here, Jason, sweat came and gave one. I'm gonna have to. It's been so long. I pulled this up.

25
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.940
Jason Charnes: 2019,

26
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.569
Jason Charnes: if it will load. Oh, connection?

27
00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:39.940
Jason Charnes: Private care.

28
00:02:49.550 --> 00:03:03.109
Jason Charnes: Yeah. So Jason gave one on cleaning up legacy code and Ernesto tag worker gave one on upgrading rails.

29
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.979
Jason Charnes: Then. Oh, we actually had 4 that year. Yeah. Oh, Noah Gibbs gave one on building your own web framework.

30
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.869
Jason Charnes: and then Julian Farher and James Hart gave one on dockerizing rails. So.

31
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.480
Travis Dockter: Nice. How did you like having those versus speakers.

32
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:33.129
Jason Charnes: I liked it so that I forgot this year. So Thursday was just workshops, and then Friday was just talks.

33
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.110
Travis Dockter: Oh, okay, so split up.

34
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.260
Jason Charnes: Yeah, it was split up.

35
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.440
Jason Charnes: I know my understanding was that the people the attendees enjoyed that

36
00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:47.999
Jason Charnes: I also wanted it to wear

37
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:57.649
Jason Charnes: like we go to big conferences. Workshops compete with regular talks like they run side by side, and like we've had 2 workshops running side by side. But

38
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.760
Jason Charnes: it wasn't like. If I go to this workshop. I miss these 2 talks kind of thing, and I think.

39
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.100
Travis Dockter: Right.

40
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.689
Jason Charnes: I think that went pretty well.

41
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.317
Travis Dockter: Cool. Yeah, no, that sounds like a great idea to me.

42
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:20.430
Travis Dockter: Did you like for the workshops, did you? Was it? Did you open like a Cfp for those workshops? Or did you reach out to people and say, Hey, will you do this workshop?

43
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.549
Jason Charnes: I want to say it was in the Cfp.

44
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.160
Travis Dockter: Oh, okay.

45
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.409
Jason Charnes: Yeah, it definitely was cause

46
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.840
Jason Charnes: the the people who did the dock rising rails one like I didn't know them before, so it would have definitely been.

47
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.309
Travis Dockter: Okay, cool. So you're like, call for talks. Or if you want to do a a workshop kind of a thing.

48
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:49.849
Jason Charnes: Yeah. And we did the workshop as an add on so like, you could just buy like the conference ticket for the one day. But it's like additional $80 to do the workshop.

49
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.779
Travis Dockter: Oh, okay, cool. I'm assuming, like for the workshop

50
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.990
Travis Dockter: people. That was the same kind of

51
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.209
Travis Dockter: deal that the speakers got like you would pay for their travel, or something like that.

52
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.780
Jason Charnes: Yeah, the we did not. We weren't able to like fully pay for travel we did.

53
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:19.359
Jason Charnes: The 1st year we paid for hotel rooms for speakers, and that like we lost. I mean, we lost my wife and I lost so much money the 1st year.

54
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.130
Jason Charnes: that we were. We were just like, we can't do this. So I want to say, like, we spent like 7 or 8 grand on hotel rooms the 1st year.

55
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.020
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

56
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.850
Jason Charnes: And running these like small conferences. I mean running any conference. Really, margins are small. But

57
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.719
Jason Charnes: the yeah, the workshops, if I remember correctly, they like

58
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.439
Jason Charnes: much like the speakers. They get a stipend.

59
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.050
Jason Charnes: If we invite you to do a keynote, we would.

60
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.160
Jason Charnes: I think we'd do a little extra like because we invited you. I want to say maybe we did hotels for keynotes, but I can't. I can't exactly remember.

61
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.525
Travis Dockter: Okay, okay,

62
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.290
Travis Dockter: So when you

63
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:34.120
Travis Dockter: for the 1st one, specifically. So, I have more more interest in that sometimes, because, I like to hear about how people were thinking when they didn't know anything, and then maybe their reflections on that, and how they would have changed stuff. But on that 1st one when you reached out to your keynote speakers. Do you remember if you already had connections with those people, or were you reaching out cold to get keynote speakers.

64
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.969
Jason Charnes: I was mostly reaching out cold.

65
00:06:38.368 --> 00:06:41.440
Jason Charnes: So oddvie Grimm. I did not know

66
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:49.559
Jason Charnes: personally like we may have met at like a Ruby Conference or something like that. But at the time he was living in Knoxville, Tennessee.

67
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.860
Jason Charnes: and it kind of felt like a perfect like, hey? You know.

68
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.860
Jason Charnes: he could drive to it right? And so we actually.

69
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.000
Jason Charnes: because of that Oddvispoke every year as a keynote.

70
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.070
Jason Charnes: Oh, nice he it was! It was cool, it kind of he called it his home conference

71
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:20.019
Jason Charnes: Ben Ornstein I met in person at Microconf that same year earlier in the year, and so I asked him in person he was.

72
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.700
Jason Charnes: But yeah, I'll do it, Ernie Miller.

73
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:29.439
Jason Charnes: I don't actually think so. I knew of Ernie. I'd seen him talk. I loved Ernie.

74
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.939
Jason Charnes: but I don't think we knew each other personally yet.

75
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.480
Jason Charnes: but he was in Louisville at the time.

76
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:43.909
Jason Charnes: which is about a couple hours north of Nashville, and so he was like, yeah, like I'd love to do it. And then, Kinsey, I want to say I met.

77
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.330
Jason Charnes: I want to say we might have known each other through conferences before that.

78
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:54.679
Jason Charnes: But yeah, so if if I did know anyone it was.

79
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.070
Jason Charnes: it couldn't have been like, you password

80
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.010
Jason Charnes: this level. Yeah, like so, but

81
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.559
Jason Charnes: everybody I asked was super receptive.

82
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.041
Travis Dockter: Awesome. That's cool, that's cool. To hear.

83
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:20.355
Travis Dockter: What was the what was the timeline on that 1st one in the in the blog post. It says you you had your your paternity leave idea. You're probably your your sleep deprived Crazy idea.

84
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.539
Jason Charnes: Yeah. Man.

85
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:29.120
Travis Dockter: In December 2016. And then when was when was that actual 1st conference.

86
00:08:30.192 --> 00:08:34.450
Jason Charnes: That conference was in October of that year.

87
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:40.189
Travis Dockter: Okay? And did you? When did you kind of start working on it in earnest? Then kind of how?

88
00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:41.989
Travis Dockter: How long was that? How long.

89
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.450
Jason Charnes: Oh, so we, you know, we started.

90
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.620
Jason Charnes: We started pretty early in the year.

91
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.069
Jason Charnes: There was only so much like upfront we could do. We

92
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.620
Jason Charnes: kind of once we lock down the dates in the venue.

93
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.440
Jason Charnes: We did that as early as we could.

94
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.350
Jason Charnes: so we drove up to we so, as an important thing to maybe note.

95
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:17.620
Jason Charnes: It doesn't really matter, but we live in Memphis, and the conference was in Nashville, and that's like a 3 h drive from us. So we actually like we went up there like looked at a venue things like that.

96
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.569
Jason Charnes: and locked that down, probably probably like March

97
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.269
Jason Charnes: April. If I had to if I had to guess. And then

98
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:35.290
Jason Charnes: it was a lot of just like sitting and waiting like watching a lot of the ticket sales like they. They trickled in slowly.

99
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.158
Jason Charnes: They kind of didn't ramp up till towards the end. So it's kind of like, oh, shit like

100
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.229
Jason Charnes: is anyone gonna be here.

101
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.780
Travis Dockter: Yeah, and so.

102
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.829
Jason Charnes: But yeah, it I mean

103
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:58.619
Jason Charnes: on and off throughout the year. But really the the majority of work was like at the beginning. And then definitely like couple of days before the conference, we were just in go mode.

104
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.165
Travis Dockter: Gotcha

105
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.690
Travis Dockter: How did you

106
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:13.558
Travis Dockter: market it like it? So in the blog post it says you had some social media. Ruby ruby flow reddit

107
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.210
Jason Charnes: I forgot about ruby flow. Yeah.

108
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:23.930
Jason Charnes: I just put it out there. I put it on rubyconferences.org

109
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.679
Travis Dockter: Did. How you market change from the 1st year to the last year like, did you learn anything.

110
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.550
Jason Charnes: Oh, not particularly.

111
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.790
Jason Charnes: I didn't particularly change anything, but

112
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:44.749
Jason Charnes: having the 1st year under our books, had, like established the conference as legitimate

113
00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:49.387
Jason Charnes: like people had actually come to this thing like

114
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.789
Jason Charnes: had taken pictures like tweeted about it. So.

115
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.360
Travis Dockter: Right.

116
00:10:55.090 --> 00:11:02.010
Jason Charnes: Not like. It was like this huge popular conference, just that, like the next year when it rolled around. And we're like, Hey, southeast Ruby. It wasn't.

117
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.499
Jason Charnes: It was like, Oh, I some people like I've heard. Maybe I've heard about that before. Things like that.

118
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.640
Travis Dockter: Right? Right? Gotcha.

119
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:25.760
Travis Dockter: okay, at at the end of your post you wrote a couple ideas that I wanted to ask you about. Now to see if you applied them, or

120
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:43.809
Travis Dockter: had changed your mind on them or anything. So at the end of the post one of the ideas you put was offer tickets to people who wouldn't be able. You wish you would have offered tickets more tickets to people who wouldn't be able to attend conferences normally. Were you able to do that in later years? And how did you.

121
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:56.679
Jason Charnes: I'm trying to think we were able to work with people with like discounts and stuff.

122
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.069
Jason Charnes: Oh, my God!

123
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:08.910
Jason Charnes: If they write in! We gave away some sponsorship. Oh, one thing we actually did was like bake in sponsorships, like, if you want to donate giving away a ticket, things like that.

124
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.250
Travis Dockter: Right.

125
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.979
Jason Charnes: So we did that in later years. I was glad we did that you. It's surprising

126
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:21.080
Jason Charnes: how hard it is to give away free tickets, though, because it involves travel. Things like that, like.

127
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.980
Travis Dockter: Right.

128
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:27.300
Jason Charnes: A lot of times we'd be like, Hey, like, here's a free ticket they're like, Oh, thanks! Like I can't make it.

129
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.740
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

130
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.755
Jason Charnes: So you kind of like cycle through the list.

131
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.763
Travis Dockter: Yeah, were there?

132
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:53.549
Travis Dockter: so I think I read in the 1st year the tickets were like 1, 75, or something like that. Did ticket prices go up, or did you kinda keep it? Because that was actually like a pretty cheap conference ticket? And I think that's really cool. I would like to keep ticket prices lower.

133
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:59.900
Travis Dockter: so that hopefully, more people are able to do it. But is, did that change at all?

134
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.050
Jason Charnes: It did.

135
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:08.699
Jason Charnes: We lost my wife, and I like funded the conference. We lost

136
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.810
Jason Charnes: almost 10 grand the 1st year, and so, like

137
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.010
Jason Charnes: luckily I had some like side consulting. I had done, and

138
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.065
Jason Charnes: and was able to write off that all my taxes which helped but

139
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.920
Jason Charnes: so we had to raise the price.

140
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:26.830
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

141
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:32.630
Jason Charnes: I can't remember what it was in 2018, but by 2019 I'm pretty sure it went up to like 2, 95.

142
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.530
Travis Dockter: Okay.

143
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.700
Travis Dockter: Yeah, cause I'm.

144
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.059
Jason Charnes: Getting that wrong. But.

145
00:13:39.410 --> 00:14:04.999
Travis Dockter: I maybe I'm making the same mistake that you did the 1st year, but I'm like looking at my venue price, and I'm looking at like, you know, some other prices, and I'm like I think I could do this. I I think I could keep my tickets under 200. I think something that you did the 1st year that you mentioned that you regretted was like room block and catering.

146
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.170
Jason Charnes: We?

147
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.569
Jason Charnes: So we actually didn't use a hotel the 1st 2 years. So we didn't have.

148
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.010
Travis Dockter: Okay.

149
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:22.309
Jason Charnes: Block we did. That was the year that we did pay for the keynote or no paid for all speakers hotels, and that was really our biggest expense, and it's something I.

150
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.520
Travis Dockter: Much catered as well.

151
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:36.419
Jason Charnes: We had lunch catered. That was I. You know there are a lot of conferences afterwards that I went to that were like we. Just. You're on your own for lunch. I was like, Damn! That's a good! I wish we I still all 3 years. We never did that, and I wish we would have

152
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:44.050
Jason Charnes: but by the 3rd year, like we kind of dialed in what we were gonna spend

153
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:44.910
Travis Dockter: Okay.

154
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.180
Jason Charnes: And something that helped again. I think.

155
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.630
Jason Charnes: after the 1st year, like being established, and putting that in, quotes air quotes.

156
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.639
Jason Charnes: it was easier, not easy, but easier to get sponsors the next 2 years.

157
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.270
Travis Dockter: Cheers, yeah.

158
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:11.240
Jason Charnes: and I think you know, one year we had someone from Dockyard write a blog post like on the dockyard blog about the conference, and like that was just

159
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:18.109
Jason Charnes: I mean, personally, it was wonderful like it was, you know. It felt good that somebody liked enough to do that. But it was, you know.

160
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.019
Jason Charnes: all that stuff helped.

161
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:30.010
Travis Dockter: Yeah. How did you get sponsors that 1st year? Was that another just like reaching out cold? And you got lucky, or did you have some connections that helped there.

162
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.899
Jason Charnes: The 1st year sponsors was tough.

163
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.400
Jason Charnes: so I'm looking at the list of sponsors, honey badger they sponsored.

164
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.030
Jason Charnes: I want to say they may have sponsored the.

165
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:55.569
Travis Dockter: One of the after parties like we did an open bar, and we did that like at the venue.

166
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.539
Jason Charnes: Hired, you know, bartenders, things like that

167
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:10.159
Jason Charnes: Ramsey solutions. So that's like Dave Ramsey, the money guy his companies like his whole operations in Nashville, and they used to do a lot of ruby. I don't know if they do anymore, but.

168
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.520
Travis Dockter: Really, I didn't know that.

169
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.320
Jason Charnes: Yeah, they were like a big rail shop. They?

170
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.519
Jason Charnes: I want to say they sponsor financially as well.

171
00:16:21.485 --> 00:16:25.870
Jason Charnes: But they also what was really cool about working with them is.

172
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.150
Jason Charnes: they were like, Hey, we, you know, we're sending our employees.

173
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:38.119
Jason Charnes: you know, a handful of them, but also like we're sending them to help. So like if you need help setting up like

174
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:50.059
Jason Charnes: So many wonderful like individuals, too, like there's a guy named John Sloan like we became friends. We stayed in touch for a while, you know. He was there all 3 years. Just great.

175
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:59.869
Jason Charnes: But those were in clear function. They were. They're a local company here in Memphis. They sponsored, but like I'm look, those were the 3, but they were all, if I remember, kind of like, you know.

176
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.220
Jason Charnes: I don't use the term like lower level.

177
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:11.415
Jason Charnes: It just wasn't like high, high monetary sponsorships, right? They were super helpful, but

178
00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.519
Travis Dockter: They weren't like huge companies donating.

179
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:25.599
Jason Charnes: They weren't like. Oh, here's a $10,000 sponsorship, right? And I again. So like the other 3 ice lab Ambu labs

180
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:37.250
Jason Charnes: and prompt. So Ice Lab and Ambu Labs. They were sponsors because they paid for travel for the speakers, their speakers. And so I was like, Hey, if you'll do that, I'll issue as a sponsor.

181
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:43.590
Jason Charnes: And then prompt was it actually merged with open, sourcing mental illness.

182
00:17:44.748 --> 00:17:48.210
Jason Charnes: It's just like a kind of awareness.

183
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.965
Jason Charnes: Nonprofit for mental health with developers. And I actually had

184
00:17:53.820 --> 00:18:00.660
Jason Charnes: a personal connection. There's a developer here in Memphis who helps like manage it. So I've kind of tell you all the sponsors just to kind of give you an idea of like.

185
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.050
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

186
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:07.460
Jason Charnes: Just because they were listed as a sponsor that for sure didn't mean, you know, it wasn't necessarily directly financial or

187
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:12.710
Jason Charnes: even like, why did you lose so much money? It was. This was very helpful.

188
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.400
Jason Charnes: and we just like mismanaged the whole thing.

189
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.189
Jason Charnes: No, we didn't. We didn't know we were doing so.

190
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.210
Travis Dockter: Yeah, yeah.

191
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.620
Travis Dockter: Gotcha.

192
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.740
Travis Dockter: So one of the oh, go ahead.

193
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:30.559
Jason Charnes: Shout out to Honey Badger for sponsoring that after party, because also I had no idea how much like

194
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.390
Jason Charnes: alcohol to buy, and I ended up

195
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.860
Jason Charnes: bringing boxes up at home, and like friends would come over and be like.

196
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.959
Jason Charnes: Are you sure you don't want like.

197
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.149
Travis Dockter: You want to take a box.

198
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:45.359
Jason Charnes: You don't want a whole handle of gin like what is like. You don't want to take this home so.

199
00:18:45.859 --> 00:19:01.340
Travis Dockter: Yeah. Well, what so another another thought that you put down at the end of that very 1st blog post was, make sponsorship more affordable and appealing, did you?

200
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.869
Travis Dockter: Why, we didn't have sponsors. Yeah.

201
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.330
Jason Charnes: Okay.

202
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.970
Jason Charnes: So when you said at the beginning of this call.

203
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:27.530
Jason Charnes: you wrote a blog post. I hadn't even thought about that blog post in like 4 years. So yeah, that is, that is actually why we didn't have sponsors. The 1st year, too, is we did it too high. And so like, I want to say Ramsey became a sponsor because they're like we're going to buy X number of tickets in exchange for our logo kind of thing.

204
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.319
Jason Charnes: And then so clear function might have been our only like

205
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:42.470
Jason Charnes: sponsor, like honey. Badger was for the after party. So the next years we released like a prospectus for sponsorship.

206
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:51.159
Jason Charnes: And the next year, actually, Ernie Miller, who's a keynote speaker the 1st year was like, I love this. I want to help you. So he actually became like a Co. Organizer with us.

207
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.416
Jason Charnes: and he handled all the sponsorships that year, too. So, like we put the perspectives together.

208
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.269
Jason Charnes: I might even be able to

209
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.289
Jason Charnes: find it. But we had more

210
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.250
Jason Charnes: that, you know. We add the like, do you want to buy a ticket for someone in the community?

211
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:06.910
Travis Dockter: Right.

212
00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.550
Jason Charnes: You know.

213
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.059
Jason Charnes: Do you just want your logo on the website? Do you want to shout out things like that?

214
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:12.880
Travis Dockter: Right.

215
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:19.750
Jason Charnes: And so the next year we had much more in terms of sponsorship.

216
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.550
Jason Charnes: So shipped was a sponsor. They

217
00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:36.994
Jason Charnes: their shop in Alabama now and then, like we had a couple of bronze sponsors. We had one company do the scholarship, so we actually kind of split it up

218
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.660
Jason Charnes: into like real tears, and that went a lot better.

219
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.029
Jason Charnes: And to the point. By the last year we didn't have as many sponsors.

220
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:54.479
Jason Charnes: but, like, listen, 3, 60 bold penguin, the easy. These companies

221
00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:03.330
Jason Charnes: they sponsored like pretty high financially. And Honey badger actually sponsored. Did they do all 3 years?

222
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.440
Jason Charnes: I know for sure, honey badger the last year.

223
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:13.010
Jason Charnes: This is my favorite thing about honey, badger sponsorships, any conference you go through? They sponsor. It's not like

224
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.449
Jason Charnes: a traditional sponsorship.

225
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:26.180
Jason Charnes: So they actually were like, Hey, find something you need to do. So we got an ice cream truck to come to the conference, and, like we all went outside had ice cream like,

226
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.780
Jason Charnes: yeah, how many Badger?

227
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.910
Jason Charnes: I'd be remiss if I didn't like.

228
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.939
Travis Dockter: Just sit here and talk.

229
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:49.029
Jason Charnes: Yeah, because it's not like they sponsor. You know, I was on a podcast. Called remote ruby. It still goes. But I was, you know they were our 1st and really only sponsor. And they're still, as far as I know, they're still sponsoring the podcast they're just really good for the community. But.

230
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.600
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

231
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.500
Jason Charnes: I digress.

232
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:55.620
Travis Dockter: Yeah. You see them everywhere on sponsorship stuff. They they give back a lot.

233
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.880
Jason Charnes: Yeah.

234
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:10.019
Travis Dockter: Okay. Another thought that you put down at the end of that was incorporate families more. What did you mean by that? And were you able to do anything around that in later years?

235
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.299
Jason Charnes: Not really you know we did the conference on Thursday, Friday.

236
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.130
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

237
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:21.330
Jason Charnes: I think every year, and the idea was that, you know, spend the weekend in Nashville.

238
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.249
Jason Charnes: you know, if you want to. So there was always kind of the hope

239
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:38.820
Jason Charnes: that that would happen. And you know, could we provide childcare things like that? But we were just so small like, you know I saw Ruby Comp do that, I thought, oh, that's cool. I want to do that. But there's no way in hell. I could afford to do that, or you know, and like.

240
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.370
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

241
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.980
Jason Charnes: My son

242
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:55.070
Jason Charnes: wasn't even one at the time we had that conference, but he was there with me, and I think that was my oldest. I think that was probably a big motivator for me to want to include that more. But.

243
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.050
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

244
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.039
Jason Charnes: I don't know.

245
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.770
Jason Charnes: There's also something beautiful about having some time away, so I don't. You know.

246
00:23:02.383 --> 00:23:07.289
Travis Dockter: True. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm thinking of doing

247
00:23:08.329 --> 00:23:19.859
Travis Dockter: my conference in the summer. So I'm yeah. I'm trying to think about like, okay, kids are out of school. You know, if people want to make it a trip to

248
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:25.310
Travis Dockter: exotic Albuquerque, New Mexico. How can I kind of do

249
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.710
Travis Dockter: a little bit more to make that easier.

250
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.090
Jason Charnes: But yeah.

251
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:31.300
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

252
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.350
Jason Charnes: No, I get that.

253
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.330
Jason Charnes: It's yeah. It's a tough balance.

254
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.810
Travis Dockter: Hmm, yeah.

255
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.380
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

256
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:57.660
Travis Dockter: okay, on that same blog post. The very last thought you put was, Have co-organizers or more volunteers. Obviously, you just mentioned that you the very next year you had a had a co-organizer. How did you guys kind of split up?

257
00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.400
Travis Dockter: Responsibilities.

258
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.750
Jason Charnes: Good question.

259
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:08.219
Jason Charnes: So I so Ernie did join us, and I

260
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:14.900
Jason Charnes: took a lot of credit for southeast ruby. But it wasn't, you know it wasn't

261
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:23.883
Jason Charnes: I? I deserved probably none of it other than like I was like, oh, I want to do this because really my wife was like a co-organizer.

262
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.390
Jason Charnes: I think she so.

263
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.439
Jason Charnes: She had just become a stay-at-home mom.

264
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:37.010
Jason Charnes: and so like, you know, that freed her up a little bit to kind of help with it.

265
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.349
Jason Charnes: And so, you know, the 1st year

266
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.919
Jason Charnes: it was us at Costco, you know, the day before, just like

267
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.450
Jason Charnes: spending a thousand dollars on things.

268
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.369
Jason Charnes: So we learned.

269
00:24:51.470 --> 00:25:02.870
Jason Charnes: oh, how to delegate a little bit more of that stuff. We also started offering volunteer tickets explicitly for free in exchange, you know, for for showing up early helping

270
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.659
Jason Charnes: being available.

271
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.209
Jason Charnes: I think we did that

272
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:12.790
Jason Charnes: if we didn't do the 1st year, we definitely did the second, 3, rd and I was really inspired to do that

273
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:22.159
Jason Charnes: because of like the Ramsey Solution folks that 1st year they were just like super helpful. Actually, the second year, this is a little bit of a digression. But the second year

274
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:32.930
Jason Charnes: Ramsey solutions was the actual venue. We have the conference they have at their old location. They had an event. Space that was.

275
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.950
Jason Charnes: It's hard to kind of like describe it in terms of size. But imagine.

276
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.169
Jason Charnes: I don't know. Like, imagine the size of a basketball gym, or something like that.

277
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:42.790
Travis Dockter: Yep.

278
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:49.310
Jason Charnes: And like full stage lights, audio and they were like yo like

279
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.239
Jason Charnes: we want to have it here.

280
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.929
Jason Charnes: for you know they didn't charge us and so that's why they were the diamond sponsor.

281
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.930
Travis Dockter: Amazing yeah.

282
00:25:58.248 --> 00:26:02.929
Jason Charnes: So you know, it wasn't Nashville proper per se

283
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.960
Jason Charnes: It was a I guess, Brentwood, technically. But you know.

284
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.790
Jason Charnes: people came, and that was actually, that was a really successful one. But we had a lot of help that year.

285
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:22.110
Jason Charnes: because again, they were like, You're doing it here. Any employees like that are going to attend the conference can help.

286
00:26:23.273 --> 00:26:24.840
Jason Charnes: Yeah. So

287
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.370
Jason Charnes: the Ernie and I delegated Ernie and I kind of split. So he did more of the sponsorship like we came up with the perspectives together. But he handled more of the

288
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.180
Jason Charnes: the outreach or the finalizing

289
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:44.619
Jason Charnes: the deals. Things like that. We always did the Cfp. Together. We also had some help doing the Cfps.

290
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.000
Jason Charnes: I know Jacob Harrington helped us one year. He's a buddy of mine in Arkansas.

291
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:59.889
Jason Charnes: We had some, just, you know, miscellaneous people help us with that because we didn't necessarily want it to just be like just me and Ernie doing it. We wanted.

292
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.729
Travis Dockter: Or something like, let me put.

293
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.479
Jason Charnes: Yeah, more input, I think, in hindsight.

294
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:14.390
Jason Charnes: So well, I don't want to say that we actually had. You know, I met a lot of really good people that I wouldn't have known outside of that

295
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.240
Jason Charnes: by having them come, speak, which is kind of the whole idea of the Cfp.

296
00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.090
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

297
00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.220
Jason Charnes: So I wouldn't say that I would have thrown it out.

298
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:31.749
Jason Charnes: but I think if I were to do it again I might try the Jason sweat cell where he select like he doesn't do a Cfp. He's just like, do you want to come talk? Do you want to come talk? I think I probably

299
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.850
Jason Charnes: like am aware of

300
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.540
Jason Charnes: enough people in the community that I could pull that off. But at the same time

301
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Jason Charnes: I don't know like there's also there's more people that I would get to meet with the Cfp. But I'm kind of again I digress here. But

302
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.089
Jason Charnes: To the question of volunteers. What do we do?

303
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.359
Jason Charnes: It was mostly so like when it came to the actual like.

304
00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:02.780
Jason Charnes: Then you, Ernie, and I and Shannon, would all look together.

305
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:11.680
Jason Charnes: came to sponsorships earlier. We do that came to like food, and like managing all that, Shannon. Usually my wife, did most of that. So we we're pretty good team.

306
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.290
Jason Charnes: Ernie is.

307
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:22.500
Jason Charnes: Ernie is one of the finest humans in the world. I think everybody who's ever worked like worked with him in any capacity says that. So.

308
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.733
Travis Dockter: Hmm! Nice

309
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:41.769
Travis Dockter: Oh, I had another question. I lost it. Oh, what was so the 1st year in the blog post you mentioned. You sold 87 tickets. How did it did it? How much bigger did it get over the years?

310
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.380
Travis Dockter: Did you ever like sell out or.

311
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:52.499
Jason Charnes: No, never, never sold out. The second year we had ample amount of space.

312
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.300
Jason Charnes: We.

313
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:04.559
Jason Charnes: for all intents and purposes, broke even. I can't remember the number of tickets we sold, but it it surpassed 100. I think the second year is our biggest year.

314
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:12.730
Jason Charnes: The 3rd year did really well, too. So the 3rd years we finally did do a hotel.

315
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.419
Jason Charnes: So we did one downtown Nashville.

316
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:22.069
Jason Charnes: and we use their space, their event space. So

317
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:31.800
Jason Charnes: even if it wasn't more tickets in the second or 1st year the space is a little smaller. So it felt packed. It felt full. It was cool.

318
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.909
Travis Dockter: Yeah, it was over a hundred, both those other, the second and 3rd years.

319
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.240
Jason Charnes: Oh, sorry! What was that?

320
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.010
Travis Dockter: It was over a hundred.

321
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:51.330
Jason Charnes: I wanna say, if it if it if it wasn't, it was around there, you know it was pretty steady the first, st you know every time I give you a number I'm gonna include the 15 speakers, too, right? So like

322
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.468
Jason Charnes: you at least have 15 people at your conference, no matter what

323
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.635
Travis Dockter: Right.

324
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:04.989
Jason Charnes: We stayed pretty steady. We were fortunate in that regard, and you know we did 3 arguably, vastly different conferences.

325
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.160
Jason Charnes: Cause. We change locations pretty dramatically within Nashville all 3 times. So.

326
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.250
Travis Dockter: Right, yeah.

327
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.390
Jason Charnes: We're pretty fortunate.

328
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.540
Travis Dockter: Nice gotcha

329
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:36.269
Travis Dockter: can you? Think of anything that you did in the conference? That? Maybe you didn't think at the time was a big deal, but afterwards people came up to you, and they're like, Wow, I'm so glad you did this thing or this thing was so cool. Is there anything like that.

330
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:43.470
Jason Charnes: Yeah. And it wasn't even my idea. So keep ruby. Weird was a conference in Austin. That

331
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.359
Jason Charnes: is one of the greatest regrets of my life I never got to go to

332
00:30:48.371 --> 00:30:53.779
Jason Charnes: terrence Lee was one of the organizers. Terrence works at Heroku.

333
00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.569
Jason Charnes: Say, Terrence is on Ruby core. Really smart individual we were talking at Rubyconf.

334
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.509
Jason Charnes: I don't know

335
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:09.010
Jason Charnes: Kansas, maybe rails, Comp. Kansas City. I don't know something right before southeast ruby and I was just talking to him about it.

336
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:15.689
Jason Charnes: he said. The thing we do is we do 30 min talks, 30 min. Break 30 min talk, 30 min break.

337
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.670
Jason Charnes: And I was like that is so much downtime.

338
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.750
Jason Charnes: But let's try it. And

339
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:39.200
Jason Charnes: again, not my idea. Everybody loved that format like. If anybody talked to me about southeast ruby, it was always I love. How much like time there is to talk to people. And I'm like, cool, yeah, like, I'm really glad. So that is something we kept every year.

340
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.789
Jason Charnes: and it's not I mean.

341
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:48.630
Jason Charnes: it works in in that format because it's single track, I mean, minus the day. We had the workshops, but it's single track.

342
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.799
Jason Charnes: There's not a ton of people there. So like

343
00:31:52.950 --> 00:32:03.120
Jason Charnes: you're in small space, you end up kind of just talking to people, even if you're not real social. You'll probably end up talking to someone, and I think that was the thing that always like made that special to people.

344
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:11.519
Travis Dockter: Yeah. Did you? Did you borrow anything else from like conferences that you went to? You saw stuff you liked and brought that to.

345
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.514
Jason Charnes: Yeah, I I really.

346
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:22.519
Jason Charnes: I wanted to try and bring the like. Ruby rails, Comp experience on like a smaller scale.

347
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:27.589
Jason Charnes: But I can't think of anything I did that was unique, you know, like

348
00:32:28.527 --> 00:32:41.190
Jason Charnes: arguably. Maybe we had too many keynote speakers, even for a like regional conference, because we always. I want to say we always had 4, except for the last year we only had 2. But that was because we it was technically single day.

349
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.919
Jason Charnes: Yeah, I'm trying to think

350
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:56.119
Jason Charnes: things. I wish I would have borrowed from conferences, not doing lunch like it's just.

351
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:56.730
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

352
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.040
Jason Charnes: We were really fortunate.

353
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.849
Jason Charnes: We you know, we had a few people with like dietary restrictions we had to watch out for, and they were actually always super grateful

354
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.339
Jason Charnes: like. It was easy to just, you know, be like

355
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:20.289
Jason Charnes: it was easy to set up. People are always grateful for that, but I wish I had just been like you. I want to say, like ruby on ales which used to happen.

356
00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.030
Jason Charnes: I want to say in Oregon.

357
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.660
Jason Charnes: I think it was that conference, or some conference that predated me

358
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:34.639
Jason Charnes: I was told would be like, yo. Here's $2030, voucher, you know, like, go eat lunch somewhere.

359
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.890
Travis Dockter: Oh, nice!

360
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:46.440
Jason Charnes: If it wasn't Ruby on ales it was. It was another one. Maybe it was like Rocky Mountain. But I was like, Oh, that's a cool idea, like, you know, it's just baked into the price, because, like, you're gonna spend that.

361
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.470
Travis Dockter: On catering, anyway.

362
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:53.529
Jason Charnes: Yeah. And it's, you know, the 1st 2 years, because we weren't at a hotel. We were like.

363
00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.059
Jason Charnes: we're working with restaurants directly, and they have to come, deliver it and.

364
00:33:59.060 --> 00:33:59.690
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

365
00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:09.989
Jason Charnes: Actually, it's a 3rd year, even even though we were at a hotel, we still catered food like we had a minimum for food included. So we did like coffee and candy and stuff. But

366
00:34:11.023 --> 00:34:22.339
Jason Charnes: you know effectively, you end up paying $20 a head for the shittiest box lunch ever. So it's like, why not give you $2030? You can go, you know.

367
00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:32.339
Jason Charnes: even in downtown, Nashville you could eat lunch pretty well, you know, on 23 bucks, or you know, or just like other conferences. Just don't give them any money and say, like.

368
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.639
Jason Charnes: there's 2 h like, it's enough time.

369
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:38.109
Jason Charnes: Wish I would have done that. I think it might have been more enjoyable.

370
00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.619
Jason Charnes: maybe, for the attendees as well.

371
00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:52.250
Jason Charnes: I liked. I really liked having a conference

372
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:57.050
Jason Charnes: sanctioned event outside of the conference.

373
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.470
Jason Charnes: So the 1st year that was the the bar at the

374
00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:09.910
Jason Charnes: at the venue. The second year we actually rented out

375
00:35:10.615 --> 00:35:17.760
Jason Charnes: like the upper floor of a bar, and just had like snacks and drinks, and like it was you. You got like tickets and stuff.

376
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:27.319
Jason Charnes: you know, and I was like watching the check the whole night like thinking that was the thing actually always surprised me is whenever we do event like that even like the speakers, dinners.

377
00:35:28.065 --> 00:35:39.184
Jason Charnes: which we could talk about, I always would be like, you know, like, Oh, shit like this is going to be so expensive, and surprisingly, it was always lower than what I thought it would be every time like

378
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.589
Jason Charnes: that is always surprising to me.

379
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:42.490
Jason Charnes: But

380
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:52.360
Jason Charnes: in the 3rd year. What event did we do? I don't remember, but that was something that I really liked doing. I don't know if we got that from another conference, or what, but having some kind of like

381
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:57.199
Jason Charnes: optional conference, sponsored social gathering was always a success.

382
00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.590
Travis Dockter: Nice. Yeah.

383
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.179
Jason Charnes: At least my perception of it.

384
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.800
Travis Dockter: Yeah. Tell me about the the Speaker's dinner?

385
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.475
Jason Charnes: Speaker Center was one of those things that's like, Hey, I can't pay for your travel.

386
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:17.420
Jason Charnes: but I at least buy you a meal. Yeah, and that was always cool, selfishly, because

387
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:23.500
Jason Charnes: it was a chance for me to like. Hang out with, you know.

388
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:27.120
Jason Charnes: with keynote speakers who, you know if I'm

389
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:35.089
Jason Charnes: you know, speakers, you know. I invited them so like obviously like, I kind of hold them in kind of like a high regard already. But then, also like

390
00:36:35.647 --> 00:36:41.690
Jason Charnes: that's how I got to know Jason. Sweat like, you know, he the year he spoke like we had Speaker dinner

391
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.000
Jason Charnes: hung out.

392
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.380
Jason Charnes: I got to spend time with Noah Gibbs. It just, you know.

393
00:36:46.890 --> 00:37:05.072
Jason Charnes: It was a cool chance for them to meet, but it was also just a really cool chance for me to get to spend some time with them. And and every year we did, you know. And again, the 1st year I was like, Hey, we'll cover food, but not alcohol. But it was. The bill was so cheap. I was like, what so like, you know, by the second 3rd year is like dude. Get whatever you want.

394
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.960
Jason Charnes: yeah. And like, I think by the last year we had gone to like.

395
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.640
Jason Charnes: not like the fanciest one in the world like we were at a steakhouse like

396
00:37:15.086 --> 00:37:20.780
Jason Charnes: that was like at the top of a building in Nashville, like it was super cool. So

397
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.349
Jason Charnes: we had some.

398
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.650
Jason Charnes: We have some cool experiences with that.

399
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.400
Travis Dockter: Nice.

400
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.700
Jason Charnes: Definitely recommend that if you can swing it.

401
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:38.490
Travis Dockter: Yeah, yeah. Would you? Are there anything else? I guess that you

402
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:45.020
Travis Dockter: wish you would have done that. You wish you would have spent more money on, or put more time into.

403
00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:52.596
Jason Charnes: It might be impossible, but I wish I would have attended the conference more.

404
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.349
Jason Charnes: I was able to the 1st year.

405
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.710
Jason Charnes: but by the second 3rd year it was just.

406
00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.780
Jason Charnes: There are too many moving parts.

407
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.700
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

408
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:15.330
Jason Charnes: I every year, all 3 years. I tried to record the talks on video.

409
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:28.619
Jason Charnes: and I regret even trying, because what it did was. I still have hard drives of these videos, but I never had the time to. I didn't have the money to pay someone to do it, and I never had the time to go. Do all of them.

410
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.070
Travis Dockter: And so I regret even.

411
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:41.613
Jason Charnes: Trying to do that because it's left me with a sense of like failure in a way. Because, you know, the speakers like they probably looked forward to that like they probably wanted that

412
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:42.550
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

413
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:50.110
Jason Charnes: So I wish I had kept it like simpler in that regard. Not trying to do everything.

414
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.969
Jason Charnes: I there's something else that came to my mind.

415
00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:03.020
Jason Charnes: I wish I attend the conference more. I wish I would have recorded video.

416
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.579
Jason Charnes: Oh, there was one other one.

417
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:13.159
Jason Charnes: I wish I would have tried harder with sponsors the 1st year. Sponsors. Really.

418
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:23.109
Jason Charnes: in my experience, sponsors have always been super chill, like.

419
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:31.580
Jason Charnes: As long as you do what you say you will, like, you know, in exchange.

420
00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.810
Travis Dockter: Pretty easy to work with.

421
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:38.110
Jason Charnes: Yeah, like to be. They typically want you to succeed as well like.

422
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:38.430
Travis Dockter: You know.

423
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:39.330
Jason Charnes: They're not.

424
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.520
Jason Charnes: It benefits both of you, and it really helps.

425
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:53.940
Jason Charnes: I'll tell you something that we did. I really liked. I don't know if I would do it again. I really liked being in a hotel the last year.

426
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.270
Travis Dockter: But.

427
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.749
Jason Charnes: Typically with hotels. You have to do a room block.

428
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.600
Travis Dockter: See.

429
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.009
Jason Charnes: Have to, you know, have to be like, well, we'll you know

430
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:09.360
Jason Charnes: we'll rent these 30 rooms, and you know, if only 20 people do, then we'll pay. You're on the hook for the last 10.

431
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.060
Travis Dockter: Right.

432
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:15.970
Jason Charnes: That was stressful. But we filled our block at least so

433
00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:21.160
Jason Charnes: it was tricky, right, like we filled it.

434
00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.049
Travis Dockter: Is. It's always a risk.

435
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:28.367
Jason Charnes: Yeah, like, it worked out. I don't know that I want to like experience that again. Yeah,

436
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:33.850
Travis Dockter: Why did you like the the experience of being in a hotel? Was it just because it was easier to keep everybody in the same place, or.

437
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:40.609
Jason Charnes: Yeah, and not everybody stayed there, you know, like, I mean, we had locals, but we also, you know, it was not the cheapest place you know. We.

438
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:41.210
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

439
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:45.290
Jason Charnes: I had friends still like doing Airbnbs and stuff. Yeah, but

440
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:59.300
Jason Charnes: it was nice, because there's a lot more opportunity like you walk downstairs, and people are in the restaurant or at the bar, and like it just created a lot more opportunity outside of the conference to see people.

441
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:06.129
Jason Charnes: and I enjoyed that I also liked.

442
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.299
Jason Charnes: I. When I go to conferences I always try and get the

443
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:19.280
Jason Charnes: like. If I go to, I'm going to rails, conf in a couple weeks. And

444
00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:26.850
Jason Charnes: there's the the hotel they have, and I always try and get the one they like recommend, like, same thing with rails. World.

445
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.970
Jason Charnes: Yeah, because, like, that's where the speakers are.

446
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.460
Jason Charnes: That's where people are hanging out.

447
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:43.840
Jason Charnes: And if the conference does it there, too, there's something nice isn't seem to get me like, Oh, it's like 2 o'clock, and I just I can't do it right now. Just be able to go up to your room. Yeah, like.

448
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.160
Travis Dockter: It's a. It's a nice thing. Yeah, very convenient.

449
00:41:48.723 --> 00:41:51.059
Travis Dockter: Do you have a a favorite conference.

450
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.469
Jason Charnes: Like I've ever been to.

451
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:55.710
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

452
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.230
Jason Charnes: That's tricky.

453
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.379
Jason Charnes: Sin City's up there.

454
00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:11.980
Jason Charnes: I have just like a weird fascination with Vegas. I'm not even a big gambler, but like I have like a shelf in my office like

455
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.056
Jason Charnes: with Vegas stuff on it.

456
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:27.059
Jason Charnes: I actually, the year before sweat, decided Houston City. I'd started looking at doing a conference, a ruby conference in Vegas. I just never pulled the trigger on it, and I'm glad, because

457
00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.240
Jason Charnes: sweat did all the work for me. And I got to.

458
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.830
Jason Charnes: Yeah, but since he's up there probably is one of my favorites.

459
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:40.010
Jason Charnes: the not just because it was Vegas, but it had all the like.

460
00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:43.909
Jason Charnes: How do I describe it?

461
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:47.500
Jason Charnes: It had all the pieces to like kind of make it special.

462
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.989
Jason Charnes: You can go do whatever you want pretty much right like Vegas, never shuts down.

463
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:56.870
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

464
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:03.040
Jason Charnes: One of my favorite memories is a group of people, not this past year, but in 2020

465
00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:07.190
Jason Charnes: 3, I guess, was the last time or 2022, whichever one.

466
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:14.859
Jason Charnes: like a bunch of us, ended up in Old Town in downtown Vegas and Fremont Street the last night, and like

467
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:27.880
Jason Charnes: they're teaching like one Guy's teaching everyone how to play craps, and everyone's just having a blast like everybody's, you know. That's the conference was fun. He always sweat, always had good technical speakers.

468
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.570
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

469
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.919
Jason Charnes: It was so laid back. Yeah, that was always special to me.

470
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:40.529
Jason Charnes: The 1st rails. Comp. I went through in 2015. It wasn't like special, but it's special to me, because

471
00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:48.450
Jason Charnes: Like I'm at Aaron Patterson. I'm at dhh, and like

472
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:54.519
Jason Charnes: not that they like remember me like right, but like it was special to me, because these are people like I.

473
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.909
Jason Charnes: I've read so much of their stuff. I've watched some

474
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:02.890
Jason Charnes: talks and stuff like I met Aaron Patterson, and he was like, Here, here's a sticker of my cat.

475
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:11.280
Jason Charnes: and I was like, that's so smart like that gives him like a thing to like, connect with someone without having to like, necessarily carry a conversation. I thought it was genius.

476
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:11.790
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

477
00:44:12.125 --> 00:44:16.149
Jason Charnes: That one's special to me because of that. It actually made me.

478
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.339
Jason Charnes: It's the 1st time I got to see the ruby community like in person.

479
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:26.729
Jason Charnes: and it was just it was kind of special to me. And that and rails ruby central as a whole.

480
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:35.129
Jason Charnes: I know, like things got weird with rails, Comp. And rails. World stuff like that, but like Ruby central as a whole.

481
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:44.949
Jason Charnes: especially like Evan and Abby Phoenix. They Marty, hot like all of them who were on Ruby Central that time.

482
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.959
Jason Charnes: And it's they made those conferences.

483
00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:49.250
Jason Charnes: They were good.

484
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:56.660
Jason Charnes: They're really good. They were well oiled like machines even. I don't know if it was like that behind the scenes, but it appeared that way, and.

485
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:57.540
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

486
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:03.980
Jason Charnes: I don't know. It holds a special place in my heart, cause it it for the last

487
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.269
Jason Charnes: god. Almost 10 years

488
00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:16.879
Jason Charnes: shit for the last 10 years has been like, it's helped me. It's been the avenue by which I gained new relationships. New friends, new

489
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:28.589
Jason Charnes: you know everything. Yeah. So yeah. And rails world's fun. I don't know. I don't think I've been to a conference. A ruby conference I don't like is maybe the best way to describe it.

490
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.550
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

491
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:34.510
Jason Charnes: Except for maybe the year at Ruby Comp. Where they didn't have water.

492
00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.029
Travis Dockter: Oh, a great water debacle!

493
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:40.259
Jason Charnes: Yeah, that was tough.

494
00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:54.040
Travis Dockter: Alright. Well, deal we'll wrap this up here so you can get back to your day. But do you have any

495
00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:05.049
Travis Dockter: resources that you would recommend for 1st time conference organizers, or any people that you would recommend, that I talk to next in this kind of format.

496
00:46:06.231 --> 00:46:09.478
Jason Charnes: I think you're building the resource

497
00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.290
Travis Dockter: This Podcast.

498
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.098
Jason Charnes: You're building the resource for people.

499
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:17.059
Jason Charnes: because the thing I did was try and talk to people who had done it.

500
00:46:17.729 --> 00:46:24.180
Jason Charnes: When Jeremy Smith started. I think he like I think I talked to him about some of this stuff.

501
00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.120
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

502
00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.829
Jason Charnes: And I know. I think you talked to Jeremy recently on this.

503
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:37.049
Jason Charnes: Yeah, I would, Jeremy. I love Jeremy Smith. He came to southeast ruby.

504
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:46.250
Jason Charnes: I think the 1st year he was like, Hey, is there a place to like park a camper van like it was awesome and but like

505
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:55.709
Jason Charnes: we didn't really become friends. It's like a moment. I know I'm diverging here, but it was like a moment for me. It's actually Sin City Ruby. I want to say. The 1st year we had breakfast.

506
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.709
Jason Charnes: and it was like me.

507
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:07.046
Jason Charnes: I can't remember who I was there, but Jeremy was there. It was just 4 of us, and we just started talking. Jeremy is such a good dude, anyway.

508
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:16.630
Jason Charnes: you're talking to people if you haven't already reach out to Jason. Sweat.

509
00:47:17.365 --> 00:47:17.729
Travis Dockter: Yep.

510
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:18.330
Jason Charnes: You know.

511
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.510
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

512
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:27.680
Jason Charnes: I know his experience. I don't want to speak for him, but I know his experience this year with the Tropicana, where he did the 1st 2 cent cities with it being gone.

513
00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:37.109
Jason Charnes: Changed his experience. You do it at the Mgm, yeah, because, like, it's a much bigger.

514
00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:38.410
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

515
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:40.840
Jason Charnes: Much bigger entity, with much higher

516
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:47.210
Jason Charnes: expectations, were like the tropicana. I mean, just walking in there. You're like, oh, this place doesn't give a shit about anything.

517
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.709
Travis Dockter: Yeah. It's all.

518
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:48.500
Travis Dockter: Also.

519
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.459
Jason Charnes: What made that place so special? Right?

520
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:52.490
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

521
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:59.250
Jason Charnes: But yeah, no, I think definitely. Talk to Jason. Sweat if you can.

522
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:05.320
Jason Charnes: If you could find any of the people who used to do. Keeper be weird like Terrence Lee, Richard Schneeman.

523
00:48:06.065 --> 00:48:10.315
Jason Charnes: Caleb. I can't remember Caleb's last name right now, but

524
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:14.849
Jason Charnes: There's also I don't know. I don't know.

525
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.809
Jason Charnes: Maybe he helps with Keeper be weird, but Nicholas means

526
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.280
Jason Charnes: he's a conference speaker for sure, like

527
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:25.940
Jason Charnes: he's got a lot of conference experience, even if he's never organized one.

528
00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:26.720
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

529
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.710
Jason Charnes: You might try and find Nicholas and tell him that.

530
00:48:29.508 --> 00:48:36.200
Jason Charnes: I recommended him because he is just a plethora of knowledge, and one of my favorite human beings in the world.

531
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:53.429
Travis Dockter: Awesome. Yeah, yeah, I plan to like, after I interview a bunch of organizers. I also want to interview speakers about their experiences, and just like people who have been to a bunch of conferences. And yeah, just get get all kinds of perspectives. But.

532
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:57.019
Jason Charnes: Yeah. You talked to Marty. Hot, right? That was.

533
00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.130
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

534
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:06.649
Jason Charnes: Evan Phoenix also might be a good one, or, if you could talk to, I don't know if she would want to. Evan's wife Abby was one of the like

535
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.139
Jason Charnes: core people who made the ruby and rails comps happen for a while.

536
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:22.920
Jason Charnes: Nice I don't know if she would be interested in going on podcasts. But she was like, I worked with her like a couple of times. And like, they're just yeah, they're they're great people. So.

537
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:23.890
Travis Dockter: Awesome.

538
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:26.480
Jason Charnes: Sorry. That's that's probably more than you wanted. But.

539
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:32.420
Travis Dockter: No, no, that's good, that's good. Gives me a lot of homework. Alright! Well, hey.

540
00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.280
Jason Charnes: Conference.

541
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.290
Travis Dockter: So it's

542
00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:48.560
Travis Dockter: right now, I'm thinking I'm gonna call it blast off rails. Just cause I I don't know. I I want to do a conference, but I want to

543
00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:59.529
Travis Dockter: it different. Like I wanna do, you know, talks or workshops. But I'm also thinking I want to do just like

544
00:50:00.329 --> 00:50:12.089
Travis Dockter: I don't know. Event type stuff like one of my ideas is, I need to find somebody that'll be willing to do this. But have you seen the show hot ones.

545
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.530
Jason Charnes: Yeah, I I know what you're talking about. Yeah.

546
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:25.289
Travis Dockter: I want to do like a hot ones interview with, like, you know, a rails community, you know, famous person, and like, get them up because it's New Mexico, right? We have.

547
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:25.870
Jason Charnes: Right.

548
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:43.860
Travis Dockter: Stuff bring them, and they can like try Chili, and we can ask them questions, and it'll be entertaining like, I kind of want to do like entertainment type stuff at the conference, too. So I'll probably blast off rails, and I'm I'm gonna try and do it in June of next year. So giving myself a year

549
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:50.320
Travis Dockter: and I'm glad I did, because everything is taking longer than I thought it would, so.

550
00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.210
Jason Charnes: Listen.

551
00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.859
Jason Charnes: I'll tell you this. I know we're out of time. But

552
00:50:54.458 --> 00:51:03.229
Jason Charnes: one thing I want to mention to that point is, I almost brought back southeast ruby 2 years ago. But

553
00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.499
Jason Charnes: I said if I was gonna do it.

554
00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.749
Jason Charnes: I was going to do it in Memphis, because I live here.

555
00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:16.050
Jason Charnes: And I was going to just like, be like Yo, we have like 6 speakers.

556
00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:29.069
Jason Charnes: And we're just gonna like hang out like it's basically gonna be an excuse to just invite all of my ruby friends. And anyone who wants to come hang out like, you know, just I think there's

557
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.820
Jason Charnes: there's something special there. I like that idea. I like your idea like,

558
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:38.119
Jason Charnes: that's cool. Is there a reason.

559
00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:45.000
Travis Dockter: Because they they are about the talks, but they're about the hallway track 2 and the experience

560
00:51:45.627 --> 00:51:50.910
Travis Dockter: and I kind of want to like elevate the stuff outside of the talks.

561
00:51:51.465 --> 00:51:58.170
Travis Dockter: You know, just to just to see what I can do and see what what we can create there. But.

562
00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:01.760
Jason Charnes: Yeah, is there a reason? You're

563
00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.700
Jason Charnes: going with like more specific like rails than ruby.

564
00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:11.729
Travis Dockter: Yeah. So I'm

565
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:33.929
Travis Dockter: so one of the after my interview with Marty Hot, he recommended a book about like, I think it's called the art of gathering, which is like about like creating the, you know, gatherings. Aka conferences. And one of the things in there was to

566
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.300
Travis Dockter: like narrowing your purpose.

567
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.880
Travis Dockter: Can be beneficial because it

568
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:50.199
Travis Dockter: it can make people want to participate more rather than saying, like, we're, you know, we're a ruby conference for anybody who loves Ruby. Just come.

569
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:50.830
Jason Charnes: Right.

570
00:52:50.830 --> 00:53:06.159
Travis Dockter: That that can be that can work for something like Ruby Central, because they have this Institute. People know them, but for myself, I feel like. If I did something really general, it might not give people enough reason to come. So if I went

571
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:28.590
Travis Dockter: narrow and I haven't. I kind of want to go even narrower than rails, but I just haven't committed to anything yet. But like if I did rails like Builders Conference, where it's just like all the talks are themed around like what people have built with rails. And all the activities are like building stuff with rails like, I feel like, if I

572
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.200
Travis Dockter: went narrower I might be able to

573
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:37.000
Travis Dockter: get people to want to come a little bit more. That's the

574
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.410
Travis Dockter: theory at this point. But yeah.

575
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:42.362
Jason Charnes: No, I was just. I was actually just curious. I I have no

576
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:51.710
Jason Charnes: no hard stance either way. I was just curious, because, you know, most of the time when we do these regional things. They are like ruby, but.

577
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:52.390
Travis Dockter: Right, yeah.

578
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:57.090
Jason Charnes: Of the talks end up, being not all of them, but a lot of them end up just being well in rails and rails and rails.

579
00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:02.720
Travis Dockter: Yeah. Well, somebody I really want to talk to is Andrew.

580
00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:07.119
Travis Dockter: I can't remember his last name he did rail. Sas.

581
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.409
Jason Charnes: Oh, Andrew Culver, yeah, look at that one. Yeah.

582
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:12.859
Travis Dockter: Yeah, because that was kind of

583
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:25.650
Travis Dockter: kind of like what I want to do. Like he had a it was a very narrow niche, like it's rails, and it's sas and I've heard so many good things about his that that conference as well, that I've.

584
00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:32.519
Jason Charnes: Yeah, that conference was that conference was also special, and and for like different reasons, it was really cool.

585
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:33.480
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

586
00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:36.459
Jason Charnes: Cool. Well, I'll stop. I'll stop interrogating you. I.

587
00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.330
Travis Dockter: Yeah. No worries.

588
00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:38.780
Jason Charnes: Learn more, so.

589
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.980
Travis Dockter: No worries. Always good talking with you, Jason.
