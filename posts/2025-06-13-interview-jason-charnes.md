Transcript

Travis Dockter: Okay, cool.

Travis Dockter: Well, welcome to what I've been calling my unofficial, unprofessional interviews of conference organizers.

Travis Dockter: so a little bit of context, I decided that I'm going to

Travis Dockter: organize my own rails conference and I wanted to reach out to

Travis Dockter: a bunch of other conference organizers and just try to

Travis Dockter: soak up their knowledge, get their experience.

Travis Dockter: ask them all kinds of questions about how they did what they did, and I know that you organized

Travis Dockter: southeast ruby a couple times, and you actually wrote a really awesome blog post after the 1st one

Travis Dockter: called organizing my 1st conference southeast ruby

Travis Dockter: and I also, like I listened to. I think you did a podcast with Jason sweat on like organizing ruby conferences. So I think I'll skip over the kind of the

Travis Dockter: the. You know the whole story of you organizing that.

Travis Dockter: But I want to dive a little bit deeper. To to kind of

Travis Dockter: get a little bit deeper than maybe what that blog post was so just to clarify though it was, was it that 1st one? Was it a 2 day conference or a 1 day conference.

Jason Charnes: It was 2 day. I think all of them were 2 day.

Travis Dockter: There were 2 days. Okay, and you got

Travis Dockter: how many? How many speakers did you have? I think it was like 4 keynote, and then 10 other 2. Did you have like 14 speakers in 2 days?

Jason Charnes: Roughly. Yeah, it alternated.

Jason Charnes: I want to say it probably alternates some each year. The last year we added some workshops in

Travis Dockter: Okay. Cool.

Jason Charnes: But yeah.

Travis Dockter: Workshops.

Jason Charnes: Do? What.

Travis Dockter: What were the workshops.

Jason Charnes: Let's see here, Jason, sweat came and gave one. I'm gonna have to. It's been so long. I pulled this up.

Jason Charnes: 2019,

Jason Charnes: if it will load. Oh, connection?

Jason Charnes: Private care.

Jason Charnes: Yeah. So Jason gave one on cleaning up legacy code and Ernesto tag worker gave one on upgrading rails.

Jason Charnes: Then. Oh, we actually had 4 that year. Yeah. Oh, Noah Gibbs gave one on building your own web framework.

Jason Charnes: and then Julian Farher and James Hart gave one on dockerizing rails. So.

Travis Dockter: Nice. How did you like having those versus speakers.

Jason Charnes: I liked it so that I forgot this year. So Thursday was just workshops, and then Friday was just talks.

Travis Dockter: Oh, okay, so split up.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, it was split up.

Jason Charnes: I know my understanding was that the people the attendees enjoyed that

Jason Charnes: I also wanted it to wear

Jason Charnes: like we go to big conferences. Workshops compete with regular talks like they run side by side, and like we've had 2 workshops running side by side. But

Jason Charnes: it wasn't like. If I go to this workshop. I miss these 2 talks kind of thing, and I think.

Travis Dockter: Right.

Jason Charnes: I think that went pretty well.

Travis Dockter: Cool. Yeah, no, that sounds like a great idea to me.

Travis Dockter: Did you like for the workshops, did you? Was it? Did you open like a Cfp for those workshops? Or did you reach out to people and say, Hey, will you do this workshop?

Jason Charnes: I want to say it was in the Cfp.

Travis Dockter: Oh, okay.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, it definitely was cause

Jason Charnes: the the people who did the dock rising rails one like I didn't know them before, so it would have definitely been.

Travis Dockter: Okay, cool. So you're like, call for talks. Or if you want to do a a workshop kind of a thing.

Jason Charnes: Yeah. And we did the workshop as an add on so like, you could just buy like the conference ticket for the one day. But it's like additional $80 to do the workshop.

Travis Dockter: Oh, okay, cool. I'm assuming, like for the workshop

Travis Dockter: people. That was the same kind of

Travis Dockter: deal that the speakers got like you would pay for their travel, or something like that.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, the we did not. We weren't able to like fully pay for travel we did.

Jason Charnes: The 1st year we paid for hotel rooms for speakers, and that like we lost. I mean, we lost my wife and I lost so much money the 1st year.

Jason Charnes: that we were. We were just like, we can't do this. So I want to say, like, we spent like 7 or 8 grand on hotel rooms the 1st year.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: And running these like small conferences. I mean running any conference. Really, margins are small. But

Jason Charnes: the yeah, the workshops, if I remember correctly, they like

Jason Charnes: much like the speakers. They get a stipend.

Jason Charnes: If we invite you to do a keynote, we would.

Jason Charnes: I think we'd do a little extra like because we invited you. I want to say maybe we did hotels for keynotes, but I can't. I can't exactly remember.

Travis Dockter: Okay, okay,

Travis Dockter: So when you

Travis Dockter: for the 1st one, specifically. So, I have more more interest in that sometimes, because, I like to hear about how people were thinking when they didn't know anything, and then maybe their reflections on that, and how they would have changed stuff. But on that 1st one when you reached out to your keynote speakers. Do you remember if you already had connections with those people, or were you reaching out cold to get keynote speakers.

Jason Charnes: I was mostly reaching out cold.

Jason Charnes: So oddvie Grimm. I did not know

Jason Charnes: personally like we may have met at like a Ruby Conference or something like that. But at the time he was living in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Jason Charnes: and it kind of felt like a perfect like, hey? You know.

Jason Charnes: he could drive to it right? And so we actually.

Jason Charnes: because of that Oddvispoke every year as a keynote.

Jason Charnes: Oh, nice he it was! It was cool, it kind of he called it his home conference

Jason Charnes: Ben Ornstein I met in person at Microconf that same year earlier in the year, and so I asked him in person he was.

Jason Charnes: But yeah, I'll do it, Ernie Miller.

Jason Charnes: I don't actually think so. I knew of Ernie. I'd seen him talk. I loved Ernie.

Jason Charnes: but I don't think we knew each other personally yet.

Jason Charnes: but he was in Louisville at the time.

Jason Charnes: which is about a couple hours north of Nashville, and so he was like, yeah, like I'd love to do it. And then, Kinsey, I want to say I met.

Jason Charnes: I want to say we might have known each other through conferences before that.

Jason Charnes: But yeah, so if if I did know anyone it was.

Jason Charnes: it couldn't have been like, you password

Jason Charnes: this level. Yeah, like so, but

Jason Charnes: everybody I asked was super receptive.

Travis Dockter: Awesome. That's cool, that's cool. To hear.

Travis Dockter: What was the what was the timeline on that 1st one in the in the blog post. It says you you had your your paternity leave idea. You're probably your your sleep deprived Crazy idea.

Jason Charnes: Yeah. Man.

Travis Dockter: In December 2016. And then when was when was that actual 1st conference.

Jason Charnes: That conference was in October of that year.

Travis Dockter: Okay? And did you? When did you kind of start working on it in earnest? Then kind of how?

Travis Dockter: How long was that? How long.

Jason Charnes: Oh, so we, you know, we started.

Jason Charnes: We started pretty early in the year.

Jason Charnes: There was only so much like upfront we could do. We

Jason Charnes: kind of once we lock down the dates in the venue.

Jason Charnes: We did that as early as we could.

Jason Charnes: so we drove up to we so, as an important thing to maybe note.

Jason Charnes: It doesn't really matter, but we live in Memphis, and the conference was in Nashville, and that's like a 3Â h drive from us. So we actually like we went up there like looked at a venue things like that.

Jason Charnes: and locked that down, probably probably like March

Jason Charnes: April. If I had to if I had to guess. And then

Jason Charnes: it was a lot of just like sitting and waiting like watching a lot of the ticket sales like they. They trickled in slowly.

Jason Charnes: They kind of didn't ramp up till towards the end. So it's kind of like, oh, shit like

Jason Charnes: is anyone gonna be here.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, and so.

Jason Charnes: But yeah, it I mean

Jason Charnes: on and off throughout the year. But really the the majority of work was like at the beginning. And then definitely like couple of days before the conference, we were just in go mode.

Travis Dockter: Gotcha

Travis Dockter: How did you

Travis Dockter: market it like it? So in the blog post it says you had some social media. Ruby ruby flow reddit

Jason Charnes: I forgot about ruby flow. Yeah.

Jason Charnes: I just put it out there. I put it on rubyconferences.org

Travis Dockter: Did. How you market change from the 1st year to the last year like, did you learn anything.

Jason Charnes: Oh, not particularly.

Jason Charnes: I didn't particularly change anything, but

Jason Charnes: having the 1st year under our books, had, like established the conference as legitimate

Jason Charnes: like people had actually come to this thing like

Jason Charnes: had taken pictures like tweeted about it. So.

Travis Dockter: Right.

Jason Charnes: Not like. It was like this huge popular conference, just that, like the next year when it rolled around. And we're like, Hey, southeast Ruby. It wasn't.

Jason Charnes: It was like, Oh, I some people like I've heard. Maybe I've heard about that before. Things like that.

Travis Dockter: Right? Right? Gotcha.

Travis Dockter: okay, at at the end of your post you wrote a couple ideas that I wanted to ask you about. Now to see if you applied them, or

Travis Dockter: had changed your mind on them or anything. So at the end of the post one of the ideas you put was offer tickets to people who wouldn't be able. You wish you would have offered tickets more tickets to people who wouldn't be able to attend conferences normally. Were you able to do that in later years? And how did you.

Jason Charnes: I'm trying to think we were able to work with people with like discounts and stuff.

Jason Charnes: Oh, my God!

Jason Charnes: If they write in! We gave away some sponsorship. Oh, one thing we actually did was like bake in sponsorships, like, if you want to donate giving away a ticket, things like that.

Travis Dockter: Right.

Jason Charnes: So we did that in later years. I was glad we did that you. It's surprising

Jason Charnes: how hard it is to give away free tickets, though, because it involves travel. Things like that, like.

Travis Dockter: Right.

Jason Charnes: A lot of times we'd be like, Hey, like, here's a free ticket they're like, Oh, thanks! Like I can't make it.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: So you kind of like cycle through the list.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, were there?

Travis Dockter: so I think I read in the 1st year the tickets were like 1, 75, or something like that. Did ticket prices go up, or did you kinda keep it? Because that was actually like a pretty cheap conference ticket? And I think that's really cool. I would like to keep ticket prices lower.

Travis Dockter: so that hopefully, more people are able to do it. But is, did that change at all?

Jason Charnes: It did.

Jason Charnes: We lost my wife, and I like funded the conference. We lost

Jason Charnes: almost 10 grand the 1st year, and so, like

Jason Charnes: luckily I had some like side consulting. I had done, and

Jason Charnes: and was able to write off that all my taxes which helped but

Jason Charnes: so we had to raise the price.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: I can't remember what it was in 2018, but by 2019 I'm pretty sure it went up to like 2, 95.

Travis Dockter: Okay.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, cause I'm.

Jason Charnes: Getting that wrong. But.

Travis Dockter: I maybe I'm making the same mistake that you did the 1st year, but I'm like looking at my venue price, and I'm looking at like, you know, some other prices, and I'm like I think I could do this. I I think I could keep my tickets under 200. I think something that you did the 1st year that you mentioned that you regretted was like room block and catering.

Jason Charnes: We?

Jason Charnes: So we actually didn't use a hotel the 1st 2 years. So we didn't have.

Travis Dockter: Okay.

Jason Charnes: Block we did. That was the year that we did pay for the keynote or no paid for all speakers hotels, and that was really our biggest expense, and it's something I.

Travis Dockter: Much catered as well.

Jason Charnes: We had lunch catered. That was I. You know there are a lot of conferences afterwards that I went to that were like we. Just. You're on your own for lunch. I was like, Damn! That's a good! I wish we I still all 3 years. We never did that, and I wish we would have

Jason Charnes: but by the 3rd year, like we kind of dialed in what we were gonna spend

Travis Dockter: Okay.

Jason Charnes: And something that helped again. I think.

Jason Charnes: after the 1st year, like being established, and putting that in, quotes air quotes.

Jason Charnes: it was easier, not easy, but easier to get sponsors the next 2 years.

Travis Dockter: Cheers, yeah.

Jason Charnes: and I think you know, one year we had someone from Dockyard write a blog post like on the dockyard blog about the conference, and like that was just

Jason Charnes: I mean, personally, it was wonderful like it was, you know. It felt good that somebody liked enough to do that. But it was, you know.

Jason Charnes: all that stuff helped.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. How did you get sponsors that 1st year? Was that another just like reaching out cold? And you got lucky, or did you have some connections that helped there.

Jason Charnes: The 1st year sponsors was tough.

Jason Charnes: so I'm looking at the list of sponsors, honey badger they sponsored.

Jason Charnes: I want to say they may have sponsored the.

Travis Dockter: One of the after parties like we did an open bar, and we did that like at the venue.

Jason Charnes: Hired, you know, bartenders, things like that

Jason Charnes: Ramsey solutions. So that's like Dave Ramsey, the money guy his companies like his whole operations in Nashville, and they used to do a lot of ruby. I don't know if they do anymore, but.

Travis Dockter: Really, I didn't know that.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, they were like a big rail shop. They?

Jason Charnes: I want to say they sponsor financially as well.

Jason Charnes: But they also what was really cool about working with them is.

Jason Charnes: they were like, Hey, we, you know, we're sending our employees.

Jason Charnes: you know, a handful of them, but also like we're sending them to help. So like if you need help setting up like

Jason Charnes: So many wonderful like individuals, too, like there's a guy named John Sloan like we became friends. We stayed in touch for a while, you know. He was there all 3 years. Just great.

Jason Charnes: But those were in clear function. They were. They're a local company here in Memphis. They sponsored, but like I'm look, those were the 3, but they were all, if I remember, kind of like, you know.

Jason Charnes: I don't use the term like lower level.

Jason Charnes: It just wasn't like high, high monetary sponsorships, right? They were super helpful, but

Travis Dockter: They weren't like huge companies donating.

Jason Charnes: They weren't like. Oh, here's a $10,000 sponsorship, right? And I again. So like the other 3 ice lab Ambu labs

Jason Charnes: and prompt. So Ice Lab and Ambu Labs. They were sponsors because they paid for travel for the speakers, their speakers. And so I was like, Hey, if you'll do that, I'll issue as a sponsor.

Jason Charnes: And then prompt was it actually merged with open, sourcing mental illness.

Jason Charnes: It's just like a kind of awareness.

Jason Charnes: Nonprofit for mental health with developers. And I actually had

Jason Charnes: a personal connection. There's a developer here in Memphis who helps like manage it. So I've kind of tell you all the sponsors just to kind of give you an idea of like.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: Just because they were listed as a sponsor that for sure didn't mean, you know, it wasn't necessarily directly financial or

Jason Charnes: even like, why did you lose so much money? It was. This was very helpful.

Jason Charnes: and we just like mismanaged the whole thing.

Jason Charnes: No, we didn't. We didn't know we were doing so.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, yeah.

Travis Dockter: Gotcha.

Travis Dockter: So one of the oh, go ahead.

Jason Charnes: Shout out to Honey Badger for sponsoring that after party, because also I had no idea how much like

Jason Charnes: alcohol to buy, and I ended up

Jason Charnes: bringing boxes up at home, and like friends would come over and be like.

Jason Charnes: Are you sure you don't want like.

Travis Dockter: You want to take a box.

Jason Charnes: You don't want a whole handle of gin like what is like. You don't want to take this home so.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. Well, what so another another thought that you put down at the end of that very 1st blog post was, make sponsorship more affordable and appealing, did you?

Travis Dockter: Why, we didn't have sponsors. Yeah.

Jason Charnes: Okay.

Jason Charnes: So when you said at the beginning of this call.

Jason Charnes: you wrote a blog post. I hadn't even thought about that blog post in like 4 years. So yeah, that is, that is actually why we didn't have sponsors. The 1st year, too, is we did it too high. And so like, I want to say Ramsey became a sponsor because they're like we're going to buy X number of tickets in exchange for our logo kind of thing.

Jason Charnes: And then so clear function might have been our only like

Jason Charnes: sponsor, like honey. Badger was for the after party. So the next years we released like a prospectus for sponsorship.

Jason Charnes: And the next year, actually, Ernie Miller, who's a keynote speaker the 1st year was like, I love this. I want to help you. So he actually became like a Co. Organizer with us.

Jason Charnes: and he handled all the sponsorships that year, too. So, like we put the perspectives together.

Jason Charnes: I might even be able to

Jason Charnes: find it. But we had more

Jason Charnes: that, you know. We add the like, do you want to buy a ticket for someone in the community?

Travis Dockter: Right.

Jason Charnes: You know.

Jason Charnes: Do you just want your logo on the website? Do you want to shout out things like that?

Travis Dockter: Right.

Jason Charnes: And so the next year we had much more in terms of sponsorship.

Jason Charnes: So shipped was a sponsor. They

Jason Charnes: their shop in Alabama now and then, like we had a couple of bronze sponsors. We had one company do the scholarship, so we actually kind of split it up

Jason Charnes: into like real tears, and that went a lot better.

Jason Charnes: And to the point. By the last year we didn't have as many sponsors.

Jason Charnes: but, like, listen, 3, 60 bold penguin, the easy. These companies

Jason Charnes: they sponsored like pretty high financially. And Honey badger actually sponsored. Did they do all 3 years?

Jason Charnes: I know for sure, honey badger the last year.

Jason Charnes: This is my favorite thing about honey, badger sponsorships, any conference you go through? They sponsor. It's not like

Jason Charnes: a traditional sponsorship.

Jason Charnes: So they actually were like, Hey, find something you need to do. So we got an ice cream truck to come to the conference, and, like we all went outside had ice cream like,

Jason Charnes: yeah, how many Badger?

Jason Charnes: I'd be remiss if I didn't like.

Travis Dockter: Just sit here and talk.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, because it's not like they sponsor. You know, I was on a podcast. Called remote ruby. It still goes. But I was, you know they were our 1st and really only sponsor. And they're still, as far as I know, they're still sponsoring the podcast they're just really good for the community. But.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: I digress.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. You see them everywhere on sponsorship stuff. They they give back a lot.

Jason Charnes: Yeah.

Travis Dockter: Okay. Another thought that you put down at the end of that was incorporate families more. What did you mean by that? And were you able to do anything around that in later years?

Jason Charnes: Not really you know we did the conference on Thursday, Friday.

Travis Dockter: Hmm.

Jason Charnes: I think every year, and the idea was that, you know, spend the weekend in Nashville.

Jason Charnes: you know, if you want to. So there was always kind of the hope

Jason Charnes: that that would happen. And you know, could we provide childcare things like that? But we were just so small like, you know I saw Ruby Comp do that, I thought, oh, that's cool. I want to do that. But there's no way in hell. I could afford to do that, or you know, and like.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: My son

Jason Charnes: wasn't even one at the time we had that conference, but he was there with me, and I think that was my oldest. I think that was probably a big motivator for me to want to include that more. But.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: I don't know.

Jason Charnes: There's also something beautiful about having some time away, so I don't. You know.

Travis Dockter: True. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm thinking of doing

Travis Dockter: my conference in the summer. So I'm yeah. I'm trying to think about like, okay, kids are out of school. You know, if people want to make it a trip to

Travis Dockter: exotic Albuquerque, New Mexico. How can I kind of do

Travis Dockter: a little bit more to make that easier.

Jason Charnes: But yeah.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: No, I get that.

Jason Charnes: It's yeah. It's a tough balance.

Travis Dockter: Hmm, yeah.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Travis Dockter: okay, on that same blog post. The very last thought you put was, Have co-organizers or more volunteers. Obviously, you just mentioned that you the very next year you had a had a co-organizer. How did you guys kind of split up?

Travis Dockter: Responsibilities.

Jason Charnes: Good question.

Jason Charnes: So I so Ernie did join us, and I

Jason Charnes: took a lot of credit for southeast ruby. But it wasn't, you know it wasn't

Jason Charnes: I? I deserved probably none of it other than like I was like, oh, I want to do this because really my wife was like a co-organizer.

Jason Charnes: I think she so.

Jason Charnes: She had just become a stay-at-home mom.

Jason Charnes: and so like, you know, that freed her up a little bit to kind of help with it.

Jason Charnes: And so, you know, the 1st year

Jason Charnes: it was us at Costco, you know, the day before, just like

Jason Charnes: spending a thousand dollars on things.

Jason Charnes: So we learned.

Jason Charnes: oh, how to delegate a little bit more of that stuff. We also started offering volunteer tickets explicitly for free in exchange, you know, for for showing up early helping

Jason Charnes: being available.

Jason Charnes: I think we did that

Jason Charnes: if we didn't do the 1st year, we definitely did the second, 3, rd and I was really inspired to do that

Jason Charnes: because of like the Ramsey Solution folks that 1st year they were just like super helpful. Actually, the second year, this is a little bit of a digression. But the second year

Jason Charnes: Ramsey solutions was the actual venue. We have the conference they have at their old location. They had an event. Space that was.

Jason Charnes: It's hard to kind of like describe it in terms of size. But imagine.

Jason Charnes: I don't know. Like, imagine the size of a basketball gym, or something like that.

Travis Dockter: Yep.

Jason Charnes: And like full stage lights, audio and they were like yo like

Jason Charnes: we want to have it here.

Jason Charnes: for you know they didn't charge us and so that's why they were the diamond sponsor.

Travis Dockter: Amazing yeah.

Jason Charnes: So you know, it wasn't Nashville proper per se

Jason Charnes: It was a I guess, Brentwood, technically. But you know.

Jason Charnes: people came, and that was actually, that was a really successful one. But we had a lot of help that year.

Jason Charnes: because again, they were like, You're doing it here. Any employees like that are going to attend the conference can help.

Jason Charnes: Yeah. So

Jason Charnes: the Ernie and I delegated Ernie and I kind of split. So he did more of the sponsorship like we came up with the perspectives together. But he handled more of the

Jason Charnes: the outreach or the finalizing

Jason Charnes: the deals. Things like that. We always did the Cfp. Together. We also had some help doing the Cfps.

Jason Charnes: I know Jacob Harrington helped us one year. He's a buddy of mine in Arkansas.

Jason Charnes: We had some, just, you know, miscellaneous people help us with that because we didn't necessarily want it to just be like just me and Ernie doing it. We wanted.

Travis Dockter: Or something like, let me put.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, more input, I think, in hindsight.

Jason Charnes: So well, I don't want to say that we actually had. You know, I met a lot of really good people that I wouldn't have known outside of that

Jason Charnes: by having them come, speak, which is kind of the whole idea of the Cfp.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: So I wouldn't say that I would have thrown it out.

Jason Charnes: but I think if I were to do it again I might try the Jason sweat cell where he select like he doesn't do a Cfp. He's just like, do you want to come talk? Do you want to come talk? I think I probably

Jason Charnes: like am aware of

Jason Charnes: enough people in the community that I could pull that off. But at the same time

Jason Charnes: I don't know like there's also there's more people that I would get to meet with the Cfp. But I'm kind of again I digress here. But

Jason Charnes: To the question of volunteers. What do we do?

Jason Charnes: It was mostly so like when it came to the actual like.

Jason Charnes: Then you, Ernie, and I and Shannon, would all look together.

Jason Charnes: came to sponsorships earlier. We do that came to like food, and like managing all that, Shannon. Usually my wife, did most of that. So we we're pretty good team.

Jason Charnes: Ernie is.

Jason Charnes: Ernie is one of the finest humans in the world. I think everybody who's ever worked like worked with him in any capacity says that. So.

Travis Dockter: Hmm! Nice

Travis Dockter: Oh, I had another question. I lost it. Oh, what was so the 1st year in the blog post you mentioned. You sold 87 tickets. How did it did it? How much bigger did it get over the years?

Travis Dockter: Did you ever like sell out or.

Jason Charnes: No, never, never sold out. The second year we had ample amount of space.

Jason Charnes: We.

Jason Charnes: for all intents and purposes, broke even. I can't remember the number of tickets we sold, but it it surpassed 100. I think the second year is our biggest year.

Jason Charnes: The 3rd year did really well, too. So the 3rd years we finally did do a hotel.

Jason Charnes: So we did one downtown Nashville.

Jason Charnes: and we use their space, their event space. So

Jason Charnes: even if it wasn't more tickets in the second or 1st year the space is a little smaller. So it felt packed. It felt full. It was cool.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, it was over a hundred, both those other, the second and 3rd years.

Jason Charnes: Oh, sorry! What was that?

Travis Dockter: It was over a hundred.

Jason Charnes: I wanna say, if it if it if it wasn't, it was around there, you know it was pretty steady the first, st you know every time I give you a number I'm gonna include the 15 speakers, too, right? So like

Jason Charnes: you at least have 15 people at your conference, no matter what

Travis Dockter: Right.

Jason Charnes: We stayed pretty steady. We were fortunate in that regard, and you know we did 3 arguably, vastly different conferences.

Jason Charnes: Cause. We change locations pretty dramatically within Nashville all 3 times. So.

Travis Dockter: Right, yeah.

Jason Charnes: We're pretty fortunate.

Travis Dockter: Nice gotcha

Travis Dockter: can you? Think of anything that you did in the conference? That? Maybe you didn't think at the time was a big deal, but afterwards people came up to you, and they're like, Wow, I'm so glad you did this thing or this thing was so cool. Is there anything like that.

Jason Charnes: Yeah. And it wasn't even my idea. So keep ruby. Weird was a conference in Austin. That

Jason Charnes: is one of the greatest regrets of my life I never got to go to

Jason Charnes: terrence Lee was one of the organizers. Terrence works at Heroku.

Jason Charnes: Say, Terrence is on Ruby core. Really smart individual we were talking at Rubyconf.

Jason Charnes: I don't know

Jason Charnes: Kansas, maybe rails, Comp. Kansas City. I don't know something right before southeast ruby and I was just talking to him about it.

Jason Charnes: he said. The thing we do is we do 30Â min talks, 30Â min. Break 30Â min talk, 30Â min break.

Jason Charnes: And I was like that is so much downtime.

Jason Charnes: But let's try it. And

Jason Charnes: again, not my idea. Everybody loved that format like. If anybody talked to me about southeast ruby, it was always I love. How much like time there is to talk to people. And I'm like, cool, yeah, like, I'm really glad. So that is something we kept every year.

Jason Charnes: and it's not I mean.

Jason Charnes: it works in in that format because it's single track, I mean, minus the day. We had the workshops, but it's single track.

Jason Charnes: There's not a ton of people there. So like

Jason Charnes: you're in small space, you end up kind of just talking to people, even if you're not real social. You'll probably end up talking to someone, and I think that was the thing that always like made that special to people.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. Did you? Did you borrow anything else from like conferences that you went to? You saw stuff you liked and brought that to.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, I I really.

Jason Charnes: I wanted to try and bring the like. Ruby rails, Comp experience on like a smaller scale.

Jason Charnes: But I can't think of anything I did that was unique, you know, like

Jason Charnes: arguably. Maybe we had too many keynote speakers, even for a like regional conference, because we always. I want to say we always had 4, except for the last year we only had 2. But that was because we it was technically single day.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, I'm trying to think

Jason Charnes: things. I wish I would have borrowed from conferences, not doing lunch like it's just.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: We were really fortunate.

Jason Charnes: We you know, we had a few people with like dietary restrictions we had to watch out for, and they were actually always super grateful

Jason Charnes: like. It was easy to just, you know, be like

Jason Charnes: it was easy to set up. People are always grateful for that, but I wish I had just been like you. I want to say, like ruby on ales which used to happen.

Jason Charnes: I want to say in Oregon.

Jason Charnes: I think it was that conference, or some conference that predated me

Jason Charnes: I was told would be like, yo. Here's $2030, voucher, you know, like, go eat lunch somewhere.

Travis Dockter: Oh, nice!

Jason Charnes: If it wasn't Ruby on ales it was. It was another one. Maybe it was like Rocky Mountain. But I was like, Oh, that's a cool idea, like, you know, it's just baked into the price, because, like, you're gonna spend that.

Travis Dockter: On catering, anyway.

Jason Charnes: Yeah. And it's, you know, the 1st 2 years, because we weren't at a hotel. We were like.

Jason Charnes: we're working with restaurants directly, and they have to come, deliver it and.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: Actually, it's a 3rd year, even even though we were at a hotel, we still catered food like we had a minimum for food included. So we did like coffee and candy and stuff. But

Jason Charnes: you know effectively, you end up paying $20 a head for the shittiest box lunch ever. So it's like, why not give you $2030? You can go, you know.

Jason Charnes: even in downtown, Nashville you could eat lunch pretty well, you know, on 23 bucks, or you know, or just like other conferences. Just don't give them any money and say, like.

Jason Charnes: there's 2Â h like, it's enough time.

Jason Charnes: Wish I would have done that. I think it might have been more enjoyable.

Jason Charnes: maybe, for the attendees as well.

Jason Charnes: I liked. I really liked having a conference

Jason Charnes: sanctioned event outside of the conference.

Jason Charnes: So the 1st year that was the the bar at the

Jason Charnes: at the venue. The second year we actually rented out

Jason Charnes: like the upper floor of a bar, and just had like snacks and drinks, and like it was you. You got like tickets and stuff.

Jason Charnes: you know, and I was like watching the check the whole night like thinking that was the thing actually always surprised me is whenever we do event like that even like the speakers, dinners.

Jason Charnes: which we could talk about, I always would be like, you know, like, Oh, shit like this is going to be so expensive, and surprisingly, it was always lower than what I thought it would be every time like

Jason Charnes: that is always surprising to me.

Jason Charnes: But

Jason Charnes: in the 3rd year. What event did we do? I don't remember, but that was something that I really liked doing. I don't know if we got that from another conference, or what, but having some kind of like

Jason Charnes: optional conference, sponsored social gathering was always a success.

Travis Dockter: Nice. Yeah.

Jason Charnes: At least my perception of it.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. Tell me about the the Speaker's dinner?

Jason Charnes: Speaker Center was one of those things that's like, Hey, I can't pay for your travel.

Jason Charnes: but I at least buy you a meal. Yeah, and that was always cool, selfishly, because

Jason Charnes: it was a chance for me to like. Hang out with, you know.

Jason Charnes: with keynote speakers who, you know if I'm

Jason Charnes: you know, speakers, you know. I invited them so like obviously like, I kind of hold them in kind of like a high regard already. But then, also like

Jason Charnes: that's how I got to know Jason. Sweat like, you know, he the year he spoke like we had Speaker dinner

Jason Charnes: hung out.

Jason Charnes: I got to spend time with Noah Gibbs. It just, you know.

Jason Charnes: It was a cool chance for them to meet, but it was also just a really cool chance for me to get to spend some time with them. And and every year we did, you know. And again, the 1st year I was like, Hey, we'll cover food, but not alcohol. But it was. The bill was so cheap. I was like, what so like, you know, by the second 3rd year is like dude. Get whatever you want.

Jason Charnes: yeah. And like, I think by the last year we had gone to like.

Jason Charnes: not like the fanciest one in the world like we were at a steakhouse like

Jason Charnes: that was like at the top of a building in Nashville, like it was super cool. So

Jason Charnes: we had some.

Jason Charnes: We have some cool experiences with that.

Travis Dockter: Nice.

Jason Charnes: Definitely recommend that if you can swing it.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, yeah. Would you? Are there anything else? I guess that you

Travis Dockter: wish you would have done that. You wish you would have spent more money on, or put more time into.

Jason Charnes: It might be impossible, but I wish I would have attended the conference more.

Jason Charnes: I was able to the 1st year.

Jason Charnes: but by the second 3rd year it was just.

Jason Charnes: There are too many moving parts.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: I every year, all 3 years. I tried to record the talks on video.

Jason Charnes: and I regret even trying, because what it did was. I still have hard drives of these videos, but I never had the time to. I didn't have the money to pay someone to do it, and I never had the time to go. Do all of them.

Travis Dockter: And so I regret even.

Jason Charnes: Trying to do that because it's left me with a sense of like failure in a way. Because, you know, the speakers like they probably looked forward to that like they probably wanted that

Travis Dockter: Hmm.

Jason Charnes: So I wish I had kept it like simpler in that regard. Not trying to do everything.

Jason Charnes: I there's something else that came to my mind.

Jason Charnes: I wish I attend the conference more. I wish I would have recorded video.

Jason Charnes: Oh, there was one other one.

Jason Charnes: I wish I would have tried harder with sponsors the 1st year. Sponsors. Really.

Jason Charnes: in my experience, sponsors have always been super chill, like.

Jason Charnes: As long as you do what you say you will, like, you know, in exchange.

Travis Dockter: Pretty easy to work with.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, like to be. They typically want you to succeed as well like.

Travis Dockter: You know.

Jason Charnes: They're not.

Jason Charnes: It benefits both of you, and it really helps.

Jason Charnes: I'll tell you something that we did. I really liked. I don't know if I would do it again. I really liked being in a hotel the last year.

Travis Dockter: But.

Jason Charnes: Typically with hotels. You have to do a room block.

Travis Dockter: See.

Jason Charnes: Have to, you know, have to be like, well, we'll you know

Jason Charnes: we'll rent these 30 rooms, and you know, if only 20 people do, then we'll pay. You're on the hook for the last 10.

Travis Dockter: Right.

Jason Charnes: That was stressful. But we filled our block at least so

Jason Charnes: it was tricky, right, like we filled it.

Travis Dockter: Is. It's always a risk.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, like, it worked out. I don't know that I want to like experience that again. Yeah,

Travis Dockter: Why did you like the the experience of being in a hotel? Was it just because it was easier to keep everybody in the same place, or.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, and not everybody stayed there, you know, like, I mean, we had locals, but we also, you know, it was not the cheapest place you know. We.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: I had friends still like doing Airbnbs and stuff. Yeah, but

Jason Charnes: it was nice, because there's a lot more opportunity like you walk downstairs, and people are in the restaurant or at the bar, and like it just created a lot more opportunity outside of the conference to see people.

Jason Charnes: and I enjoyed that I also liked.

Jason Charnes: I. When I go to conferences I always try and get the

Jason Charnes: like. If I go to, I'm going to rails, conf in a couple weeks. And

Jason Charnes: there's the the hotel they have, and I always try and get the one they like recommend, like, same thing with rails. World.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, because, like, that's where the speakers are.

Jason Charnes: That's where people are hanging out.

Jason Charnes: And if the conference does it there, too, there's something nice isn't seem to get me like, Oh, it's like 2 o'clock, and I just I can't do it right now. Just be able to go up to your room. Yeah, like.

Travis Dockter: It's a. It's a nice thing. Yeah, very convenient.

Travis Dockter: Do you have a a favorite conference.

Jason Charnes: Like I've ever been to.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: That's tricky.

Jason Charnes: Sin City's up there.

Jason Charnes: I have just like a weird fascination with Vegas. I'm not even a big gambler, but like I have like a shelf in my office like

Jason Charnes: with Vegas stuff on it.

Jason Charnes: I actually, the year before sweat, decided Houston City. I'd started looking at doing a conference, a ruby conference in Vegas. I just never pulled the trigger on it, and I'm glad, because

Jason Charnes: sweat did all the work for me. And I got to.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, but since he's up there probably is one of my favorites.

Jason Charnes: the not just because it was Vegas, but it had all the like.

Jason Charnes: How do I describe it?

Jason Charnes: It had all the pieces to like kind of make it special.

Jason Charnes: You can go do whatever you want pretty much right like Vegas, never shuts down.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: One of my favorite memories is a group of people, not this past year, but in 2020

Jason Charnes: 3, I guess, was the last time or 2022, whichever one.

Jason Charnes: like a bunch of us, ended up in Old Town in downtown Vegas and Fremont Street the last night, and like

Jason Charnes: they're teaching like one Guy's teaching everyone how to play craps, and everyone's just having a blast like everybody's, you know. That's the conference was fun. He always sweat, always had good technical speakers.

Travis Dockter: Hmm.

Jason Charnes: It was so laid back. Yeah, that was always special to me.

Jason Charnes: The 1st rails. Comp. I went through in 2015. It wasn't like special, but it's special to me, because

Jason Charnes: Like I'm at Aaron Patterson. I'm at dhh, and like

Jason Charnes: not that they like remember me like right, but like it was special to me, because these are people like I.

Jason Charnes: I've read so much of their stuff. I've watched some

Jason Charnes: talks and stuff like I met Aaron Patterson, and he was like, Here, here's a sticker of my cat.

Jason Charnes: and I was like, that's so smart like that gives him like a thing to like, connect with someone without having to like, necessarily carry a conversation. I thought it was genius.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: That one's special to me because of that. It actually made me.

Jason Charnes: It's the 1st time I got to see the ruby community like in person.

Jason Charnes: and it was just it was kind of special to me. And that and rails ruby central as a whole.

Jason Charnes: I know, like things got weird with rails, Comp. And rails. World stuff like that, but like Ruby central as a whole.

Jason Charnes: especially like Evan and Abby Phoenix. They Marty, hot like all of them who were on Ruby Central that time.

Jason Charnes: And it's they made those conferences.

Jason Charnes: They were good.

Jason Charnes: They're really good. They were well oiled like machines even. I don't know if it was like that behind the scenes, but it appeared that way, and.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: I don't know. It holds a special place in my heart, cause it it for the last

Jason Charnes: god. Almost 10 years

Jason Charnes: shit for the last 10 years has been like, it's helped me. It's been the avenue by which I gained new relationships. New friends, new

Jason Charnes: you know everything. Yeah. So yeah. And rails world's fun. I don't know. I don't think I've been to a conference. A ruby conference I don't like is maybe the best way to describe it.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: Except for maybe the year at Ruby Comp. Where they didn't have water.

Travis Dockter: Oh, a great water debacle!

Jason Charnes: Yeah, that was tough.

Travis Dockter: Alright. Well, deal we'll wrap this up here so you can get back to your day. But do you have any

Travis Dockter: resources that you would recommend for 1st time conference organizers, or any people that you would recommend, that I talk to next in this kind of format.

Jason Charnes: I think you're building the resource

Travis Dockter: This Podcast.

Jason Charnes: You're building the resource for people.

Jason Charnes: because the thing I did was try and talk to people who had done it.

Jason Charnes: When Jeremy Smith started. I think he like I think I talked to him about some of this stuff.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: And I know. I think you talked to Jeremy recently on this.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, I would, Jeremy. I love Jeremy Smith. He came to southeast ruby.

Jason Charnes: I think the 1st year he was like, Hey, is there a place to like park a camper van like it was awesome and but like

Jason Charnes: we didn't really become friends. It's like a moment. I know I'm diverging here, but it was like a moment for me. It's actually Sin City Ruby. I want to say. The 1st year we had breakfast.

Jason Charnes: and it was like me.

Jason Charnes: I can't remember who I was there, but Jeremy was there. It was just 4 of us, and we just started talking. Jeremy is such a good dude, anyway.

Jason Charnes: you're talking to people if you haven't already reach out to Jason. Sweat.

Travis Dockter: Yep.

Jason Charnes: You know.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: I know his experience. I don't want to speak for him, but I know his experience this year with the Tropicana, where he did the 1st 2 cent cities with it being gone.

Jason Charnes: Changed his experience. You do it at the Mgm, yeah, because, like, it's a much bigger.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: Much bigger entity, with much higher

Jason Charnes: expectations, were like the tropicana. I mean, just walking in there. You're like, oh, this place doesn't give a shit about anything.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. It's all.

Travis Dockter: Also.

Jason Charnes: What made that place so special? Right?

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: But yeah, no, I think definitely. Talk to Jason. Sweat if you can.

Jason Charnes: If you could find any of the people who used to do. Keeper be weird like Terrence Lee, Richard Schneeman.

Jason Charnes: Caleb. I can't remember Caleb's last name right now, but

Jason Charnes: There's also I don't know. I don't know.

Jason Charnes: Maybe he helps with Keeper be weird, but Nicholas means

Jason Charnes: he's a conference speaker for sure, like

Jason Charnes: he's got a lot of conference experience, even if he's never organized one.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: You might try and find Nicholas and tell him that.

Jason Charnes: I recommended him because he is just a plethora of knowledge, and one of my favorite human beings in the world.

Travis Dockter: Awesome. Yeah, yeah, I plan to like, after I interview a bunch of organizers. I also want to interview speakers about their experiences, and just like people who have been to a bunch of conferences. And yeah, just get get all kinds of perspectives. But.

Jason Charnes: Yeah. You talked to Marty. Hot, right? That was.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: Evan Phoenix also might be a good one, or, if you could talk to, I don't know if she would want to. Evan's wife Abby was one of the like

Jason Charnes: core people who made the ruby and rails comps happen for a while.

Jason Charnes: Nice I don't know if she would be interested in going on podcasts. But she was like, I worked with her like a couple of times. And like, they're just yeah, they're they're great people. So.

Travis Dockter: Awesome.

Jason Charnes: Sorry. That's that's probably more than you wanted. But.

Travis Dockter: No, no, that's good, that's good. Gives me a lot of homework. Alright! Well, hey.

Jason Charnes: Conference.

Travis Dockter: So it's

Travis Dockter: right now, I'm thinking I'm gonna call it blast off rails. Just cause I I don't know. I I want to do a conference, but I want to

Travis Dockter: it different. Like I wanna do, you know, talks or workshops. But I'm also thinking I want to do just like

Travis Dockter: I don't know. Event type stuff like one of my ideas is, I need to find somebody that'll be willing to do this. But have you seen the show hot ones.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, I I know what you're talking about. Yeah.

Travis Dockter: I want to do like a hot ones interview with, like, you know, a rails community, you know, famous person, and like, get them up because it's New Mexico, right? We have.

Jason Charnes: Right.

Travis Dockter: Stuff bring them, and they can like try Chili, and we can ask them questions, and it'll be entertaining like, I kind of want to do like entertainment type stuff at the conference, too. So I'll probably blast off rails, and I'm I'm gonna try and do it in June of next year. So giving myself a year

Travis Dockter: and I'm glad I did, because everything is taking longer than I thought it would, so.

Jason Charnes: Listen.

Jason Charnes: I'll tell you this. I know we're out of time. But

Jason Charnes: one thing I want to mention to that point is, I almost brought back southeast ruby 2 years ago. But

Jason Charnes: I said if I was gonna do it.

Jason Charnes: I was going to do it in Memphis, because I live here.

Jason Charnes: And I was going to just like, be like Yo, we have like 6 speakers.

Jason Charnes: And we're just gonna like hang out like it's basically gonna be an excuse to just invite all of my ruby friends. And anyone who wants to come hang out like, you know, just I think there's

Jason Charnes: there's something special there. I like that idea. I like your idea like,

Jason Charnes: that's cool. Is there a reason.

Travis Dockter: Because they they are about the talks, but they're about the hallway track 2 and the experience

Travis Dockter: and I kind of want to like elevate the stuff outside of the talks.

Travis Dockter: You know, just to just to see what I can do and see what what we can create there. But.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, is there a reason? You're

Jason Charnes: going with like more specific like rails than ruby.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. So I'm

Travis Dockter: so one of the after my interview with Marty Hot, he recommended a book about like, I think it's called the art of gathering, which is like about like creating the, you know, gatherings. Aka conferences. And one of the things in there was to

Travis Dockter: like narrowing your purpose.

Travis Dockter: Can be beneficial because it

Travis Dockter: it can make people want to participate more rather than saying, like, we're, you know, we're a ruby conference for anybody who loves Ruby. Just come.

Jason Charnes: Right.

Travis Dockter: That that can be that can work for something like Ruby Central, because they have this Institute. People know them, but for myself, I feel like. If I did something really general, it might not give people enough reason to come. So if I went

Travis Dockter: narrow and I haven't. I kind of want to go even narrower than rails, but I just haven't committed to anything yet. But like if I did rails like Builders Conference, where it's just like all the talks are themed around like what people have built with rails. And all the activities are like building stuff with rails like, I feel like, if I

Travis Dockter: went narrower I might be able to

Travis Dockter: get people to want to come a little bit more. That's the

Travis Dockter: theory at this point. But yeah.

Jason Charnes: No, I was just. I was actually just curious. I I have no

Jason Charnes: no hard stance either way. I was just curious, because, you know, most of the time when we do these regional things. They are like ruby, but.

Travis Dockter: Right, yeah.

Jason Charnes: Of the talks end up, being not all of them, but a lot of them end up just being well in rails and rails and rails.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. Well, somebody I really want to talk to is Andrew.

Travis Dockter: I can't remember his last name he did rail. Sas.

Jason Charnes: Oh, Andrew Culver, yeah, look at that one. Yeah.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, because that was kind of

Travis Dockter: kind of like what I want to do. Like he had a it was a very narrow niche, like it's rails, and it's sas and I've heard so many good things about his that that conference as well, that I've.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, that conference was that conference was also special, and and for like different reasons, it was really cool.

Travis Dockter: Yeah.

Jason Charnes: Cool. Well, I'll stop. I'll stop interrogating you. I.

Travis Dockter: Yeah. No worries.

Jason Charnes: Learn more, so.

Travis Dockter: No worries. Always good talking with you, Jason.

Jason Charnes: Yeah, likewise.

Travis Dockter: Your time. And are you gonna be at rails? Comp. This year? The last one.

Jason Charnes: Be at rails. Confidence right now be at rails world. So all the all the rails.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, I didn't. I didn't get a rails world ticket, but I will. I will see you at at rails. Comp.

Jason Charnes: All right. I'll see you a few weeks, then.

Travis Dockter: Yeah, Yup, alrighty! Take care, man, I'll talk to you.

Jason Charnes: I appreciate it.

Travis Dockter: All right.
