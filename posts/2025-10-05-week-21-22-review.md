excerpt: Remote Ruby episode released!
---

The Remote Ruby episode that I did came out on Friday and drove a little traffic to the conference site. I am hoping it leads to more talk submissions and maybe some ticket sales. I did listen to it and I feel like I did a decent job of not sounding like an idiot. Chris and Andrew were great hosts and I hope people enjoy it.

A sponsor that I have been talking with let me know that because of corporate stuff they will have to get back to me in February regarding their contribution. This is a bummer because I don't want to assume that they are a confirmed sponsor and then a couple months out from the conference things fall through. I am very lucky that I have already gotten money from two other sponsors with almost 10 months to go before the conference but it isn't enough to make me feel comfortable. I think I will reach out to a couple other companies and see if I can get one or two more to fill the gap just in case. I really don't want to take on a ton of sponsors but I also don't want to end up in a positional where I am losing a large amount of money.

Another reason the money is a bit of an issue is that I want to confirm with Con Freaks that we will be doing video recordings of the talks but now I am nervous about doing that without firm financial backing. I think I am going to take a chance and confirm it anyway just based on a feeling that I can find more sponsors if I absolutely need to. Probably going against my own advice here of keep it simple and reduce risk.

Ticket Sales: 1

CFP Submissions: 27
