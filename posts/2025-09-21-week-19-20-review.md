I missed last week's review. Sorry about that. That week was actually the interesting one and this week I didn't do much so I will make this a two week review.

I opened the CFP! I ended up going with PaperCall instead of the Evil Martian alternative. I was slightly uncomfortable being unfamiliar with the technology (let's ignore what this says about me as an engineer and person for now). Also, my use case is very simple (single track, small conference) and PaperCall is essentially free for cases like mine. I believe Evil Martians built their own solution because their use case was much more complex (multiple tracks, multiple types of tracks). I love using tools built by our own community, but I think in this case I did the right thing by just keeping it simple.

I went on the Remote Ruby podcast and the episode should be coming out in a week or two. My goal here is obviously to spread more awareness about the conference and the CFP. Chris and Andrew were gracious enough to let me come on and talk about it. It was a real honor to be able to go on a podcast that is well known in our community and whose hosts are equally well known and respected. I will spare you any reflections on how I feel I did. It was my first time ever being on a podcast of any sort. Chris and Andrew were great hosts and asked great questions about how I am going about building the conference. I hope that will be interesting to their listeners. I feel a little bad because it is conference season and maybe people are tired of all the conference talk by now but most likely I am overthinking it.

I am keeping early bird tickets open until after speakers are chosen from the CFP so that if you want to try your hand at getting a free ticket by being a speaker you don't have to give up the early bird pricing altogether if you are not chosen. Knowing this I am not expecting there to be many ticket sales until I choose the speakers. Which means I can't really push ticket sales until February-ish. Which is probably fine. That is still 4 months before the conference.
