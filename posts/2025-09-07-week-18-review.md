Not a whole lot to update this week. The combination of working some extra hours at my day job (conference organizing being my night job) and the incredibly poorly timed release of the sequel to one of my favorite video games of all time (Hollow Knight) has left me with very little free time. I did manage to find some time to clone down the Evil Martians open source CFP application and start making some tweaks to it. For one reason or another I wasn't able to get it running locally the way they intended but I did manage to get it running in a docker container. The backend is a rails app but the frontend is in React (using inertia.js) and I haven't dabbled in React for several years. I am a little nervous to be running an important aspect of the conference with technology I am unfamiliar with (especially after failing at their local setup). What if something important breaks? What if I lose peoples applications? Luckily I am wrapping up the important projects at work this Thursday and after that I will have the weekend to hopefully get this CFP application up and running smoothly. Still nervous. Optimistic that I will feel better next week. I will let you know.
