- Finding contact information is proving harder than I thought. I thought you could dm people on socials but no. I guess not leaving your email address out there on the open web is a good idea. I think LinkedIn will be go to for messaging people I don't know.
- Listened to the Remote Ruby episode with the Rocky Mountain Ruby folks and it was very inspiring and scary and informational. I definitely want to talk to these folks.
- I set up socials and quickly found out you can't just message anyone. That sucks.
- I wrote a template cold email and decided it was kind of useless. I should just write short personal messages to people.
