Transcript

1
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.718
Travis Dockter: Okay, all right. Well, welcome to these.

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.439
Travis Dockter: I've been saying many different adjectives, but

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:30.709
Travis Dockter: impromptu unofficial, or a couple of them organizer chats that I've been having. A little bit of context for you. So actually,

4
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:42.380
Travis Dockter: you are the organizer of, or former organizer, we'll say of Sin City ruby, which is going to be an interesting chat

5
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:52.949
Travis Dockter: specifically, because you're the 1st organizer that I'm speaking to, that I actually have been to your conference multiple times.

6
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.429
Travis Dockter: so that's gonna

7
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:08.129
Travis Dockter: kind of get to see a little bit of behind the scenes of a conference that I got to see. You know, from a firsthand perspective. And you also have a kind of an interesting

8
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.729
Travis Dockter: and ask people about their 1st conference, because I kind of want to know, like, maybe

9
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:40.619
Travis Dockter: what they learned from their 1st conference to their last conference and kind of you know what what their 1st experience was like, so that maybe I can avoid some of the pitfalls, or just do some of the things as if I were a more experienced organizer. Right? So

10
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:56.820
Travis Dockter: you have a very unique origin story for your conference, because you never planned to have a conference. At 1st you booked space for a class, and then you found it hard to sell tickets for a class. And so you pivoted to

11
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.040
Travis Dockter: what was that? What was that experience like. And what was it like to

12
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:11.009
Travis Dockter: kind of have in mind? Okay, I'm I'm doing this class. And then all of a sudden, you're organizing a conference. What was that kind of like.

13
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.270
Jason Swett: Yeah, it was not as big of a deal as it might sound like, because

14
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.999
Jason Swett: conference doesn't have to mean like a big

15
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:32.399
Jason Swett: rails Comp type thing or something like that. It can just be a small get together. And I had talked previously with Andy Kroll, who organizes Bright and Ruby.

16
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:41.789
Jason Swett: and he had said that when he did the 1st Brighton ruby he planned it such that if only 50 people came that would be okay.

17
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.580
Jason Swett: And so I kept that in mind.

18
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.829
Jason Swett: and indeed we had maybe about 40 people ultimately come to that 1st one

19
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.649
Jason Swett: and it was okay. I lost a little bit of money, but not much

20
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:07.549
Jason Swett: and it felt kind of like a meetup, almost, because it was just small. I've certainly been to meetups that are a lot bigger than the 1st Sin City ruby was.

21
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:13.229
Jason Swett: So yeah, it. It didn't feel like that big of a deal.

22
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.980
Jason Swett: There was some money on the line and all that stuff. But the numbers weren't huge, and it wasn't all that stressful.

23
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.190
Travis Dockter: Did you?

24
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.759
Travis Dockter: Or you knew you were organizing a conference, or once you knew you were organizing conference. Then you reached out to him.

25
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.980
Travis Dockter: When did that conversation happen?

26
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.310
Jason Swett: Sorry the connection's a little choppy. Can you say that again?

27
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.860
Travis Dockter: Okay, yeah. So when did you did you talk to Andy Kroll after

28
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.259
Travis Dockter: conference and like, reached out to him.

29
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.330
Jason Swett: No. I think I talked to him before, just on the podcast. On the code, with Jason podcast.

30
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.479
Travis Dockter: Oh, okay, nice gotcha how long did you have

31
00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:04.539
Travis Dockter: to kind of pull that 1st one together? And was it kind of a rush to like, get speakers and sponsors and stuff. How much of that were you able to do.

32
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.469
Jason Swett: I had a decent amount of time.

33
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:16.399
Jason Swett: I remember that it was 2022 when the conference occurred, and so I had started planning it

34
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.159
Jason Swett: around the fall of 2021, so fall of 2021 to

35
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.630
Jason Swett: march, or April of 2022.

36
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.599
Jason Swett: So I had a number of months.

37
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.000
Travis Dockter: Okay.

38
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.630
Jason Swett: For me. Getting speakers was easy. I chose not to do a Cfp. Or anything like that, because I wanted to to keep the

39
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.470
Jason Swett: the workload as light as possible.

40
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.790
Jason Swett: So I just handpicked the speakers.

41
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.759
Jason Swett: And I already knew people from my podcast so that was pretty easy

42
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.119
Jason Swett: and then let's see, there was another part of your question, but I don't remember what it was.

43
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.749
Travis Dockter: Were there? Were there any sponsors for that 1st one.

44
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.840
Jason Swett: No, I chose not to do sponsors, because again, I wanted to keep the workload light and keep it simple.

45
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.419
Travis Dockter: Gotcha. So did you? Did you?

46
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.629
Travis Dockter: That you could like try to break even with just ticket sales for that for that 1st one.

47
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:28.360
Jason Swett: Yeah. I thought there was a good likelihood that I could break even, and I came pretty close. I think we lost like 2,000 bucks on that event.

48
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.390
Jason Swett: And it was here. Here's a mistake that I made.

49
00:05:33.093 --> 00:05:39.406
Jason Swett: So my wife core co-organizes the event. That's not the mistake.

50
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.960
Jason Swett: I'm just saying that for context. But we chose to do catering for that 1st conference.

51
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.320
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

52
00:05:49.550 --> 00:06:00.009
Jason Swett: and it cost it cost an insane amount. I don't remember, but it was like 40 bucks a person, for, like a crappy sandwich, and some chips, or something like that.

53
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.740
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

54
00:06:01.613 --> 00:06:18.920
Jason Swett: And so I don't know. 40 times 40 is 1,600. It was, I think it was more than that even but like nobody. It turns out nobody was expecting us to provide food, and, like hardly anybody, even ate the food they like, went out to lunch.

55
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.320
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

56
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:27.439
Jason Swett: And so that was kind of just like a total waste. And if we hadn't done that we would have been in the black instead of in the red.

57
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.080
Travis Dockter: Right.

58
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:36.779
Jason Swett: For the following 2 years, because I did it a total of 3 times the following 2 years. I didn't do catering.

59
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.896
Travis Dockter: Gotcha? Yeah.

60
00:06:41.170 --> 00:07:03.239
Travis Dockter: when you went to do sponsors the second year, did that factor in like, did you come up with a budget of like, okay, I'm gonna set ticket prices here. And I, wanna, I have a goal of like getting this much sponsorship money. Did you kind of plan that out that way, or how did you think about that?

61
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.519
Jason Swett: I didn't have a goal. I just wanted to get as many sponsors as I realistically could.

62
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:22.149
Jason Swett: so I did no sponsors the 1st 2 years, and then the 3rd and final year was the only year in which I did sponsors. I just made a list of like the

63
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:48.130
Jason Swett: places that I knew of, that I thought might be sponsors like I looked at people who had sponsored other conferences and stuff like that, and I thought of like people I knew and stuff like that. I think the 1st place I reached out to was evil Martians, because I know arena from evil Martians, and I know that they sponsor a lot of conferences. So I reached out to her and she said, Yes.

64
00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:52.043
Jason Swett: got a couple other sponsors, too.

65
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.090
Jason Swett: and financially that helped out a lot.

66
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:04.090
Jason Swett: I think I got somewhere in the neighborhood of like $10,000 worth of sponsorship that 3rd year.

67
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.490
Jason Swett: Gotcha.

68
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:11.719
Jason Swett: But the expenses for that 3rd year were also really high, and I ended up losing

69
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:23.150
Jason Swett: a lot of money. But that's a different story with the sponsors. Yeah, I just kind of made a list, and then went through and asked people. Some people said no, and some people said, Yes.

70
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.430
Travis Dockter: Was it? Was it a lot of

71
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:33.669
Travis Dockter: connections with people you already knew? Or were you doing some like cold outreach just reaching out to people you didn't know, asking them to sponsor.

72
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.580
Jason Swett: I think both, but definitely, mostly people I already knew.

73
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.210
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

74
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:48.000
Jason Swett: And in fact, maybe entirely people I already knew. I don't remember now, because it was a bit ago that I was going through

75
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.710
Jason Swett: all that.

76
00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:54.180
Jason Swett: Let's see, there was evil Martians cedar code.

77
00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:01.479
Jason Swett: Cisco Meraki sponsored, which is actually where I where I work now. Incidentally,

78
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.900
Jason Swett: And I feel bad if I'm forgetting anybody, but I think those were the 3.

79
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.860
Travis Dockter: Yeah. Okay.

80
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:24.649
Travis Dockter: And you mentioned earlier that you you don't do a Cfp or you didn't do Cfp, you just kind of chose your speakers. Did you have any kind of

81
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.510
Travis Dockter: I don't know. Plan, for when you were reaching out to people did you want to like.

82
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:39.869
Travis Dockter: or did you just kind of reach out to people that you liked, and ask them to to do whatever talk.

83
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:47.740
Jason Swett: Yeah, I just reached out to people who I thought would make sense. You know, some people have kind of a draw

84
00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:50.269
Jason Swett: like, for example.

85
00:09:50.390 --> 00:10:02.660
Jason Swett: I think I tried to get Chris Oliver to speak for at least 2 years, maybe even all 3 times. On the 3rd time I finally got him, and he came and spoke.

86
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:10.410
Jason Swett: but I picked him largely because I thought he would have a draw. You know he's he's very much a known entity in the ruby community.

87
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.099
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

88
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.840
Jason Swett: So I kind of did it like that.

89
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:23.780
Jason Swett: yeah. And that's that's how it went. I really had no interest in ever doing a Cfp, because that just sounds like a lot of work.

90
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.040
Travis Dockter: Did you? Did you

91
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:33.470
Travis Dockter: give speakers any guidance on what their talk should be like? Or you just said you have 30 min.

92
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.960
Travis Dockter: whatever you want.

93
00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:50.437
Jason Swett: If they asked for guidance, I I would give that to them for sure. Most of the people were pretty experienced conference speakers, so they didn't really need it. They only ask questions like, How long do you want my talk to be? And stuff like that? Right?

94
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.609
Jason Swett: I have, I think probably every year I've had at least 1 1st time speaker

95
00:10:57.192 --> 00:11:09.399
Jason Swett: and sometimes they've asked for some some guidance. Like, hey? I'm thinking of speaking about this? Does that sound good, whatever and so I I

96
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.240
Jason Swett: give them some feedback on that, and just in general, like how

97
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:21.199
Jason Swett: how long their talk should be like, I tell people that shorter is better.

98
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:27.880
Jason Swett: Like. Don't feel like you have to fill 45 min or something like that like.

99
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.819
Jason Swett: if you go and speak for 20 min like

100
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.590
Jason Swett: no one has ever been sad, that a talk was like too short, you know.

101
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.330
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

102
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.439
Jason Swett: Something I heard once about public speaking is, people are just waiting for you to be done.

103
00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:44.830
Travis Dockter: And.

104
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.809
Jason Swett: And it's it's kind of a sad truth.

105
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.800
Jason Swett: but yeah, I gave advice to those newer speakers, but again, a lot of them were already quite experienced.

106
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.699
Travis Dockter: Gotcha did you? Do? Did you like

107
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.780
Travis Dockter: pay for speakers? Travel, or give them a honorarium, or anything like that?

108
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:17.270
Jason Swett: Yeah, we did what we could for for speakers, I think all 3 years. What we did was we just gave them an honorarium.

109
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:25.219
Jason Swett: and I have never looked up the definition of honorarium. But I think it's kind of like

110
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:40.319
Jason Swett: this is some money that we're giving you. We know that it's not nearly as much as we should be giving you. But here's something as like a token of our appreciation that can at least help cover your travel a little bit.

111
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.790
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

112
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.149
Jason Swett: And I base the amount on

113
00:12:43.490 --> 00:13:03.039
Jason Swett: what I had been paid at conferences that I've spoken at in past years, which is usually $0. But some conferences I've I've gone to, and they pay like a $500 honorarium or something like that. So I based that on that.

114
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.775
Travis Dockter: Gotcha

115
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.880
Travis Dockter: Let's see, I have some other questions here.

116
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.739
Travis Dockter: So you have mentioned that you are done with, since

117
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:28.060
Travis Dockter: you might do other ruby events in the future. Can you give us any idea of like what you're thinking about, and how

118
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.849
Travis Dockter: you're thinking about doing things differently from Sin City ruby, or maybe just conferences in general.

119
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:40.598
Jason Swett: Yeah, there's 2 main reasons. I'm not inclined to do more sin city ruby events.

120
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:49.120
Jason Swett: one is that sin city ruby happens in Las Vegas, and I live in Michigan, and that's a long ways away.

121
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:59.630
Jason Swett: And the other is in Las Vegas. It's hard to find a venue that is affordable

122
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.530
Jason Swett: and like checks all the boxes we need to check and stuff like that.

123
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.400
Jason Swett: And

124
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:16.760
Jason Swett: the 3rd Sin City ruby was just a big financial risk for us, and, like I mentioned, we we lost a lot of money. So I don't want to do that again.

125
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.449
Jason Swett: But what I would.

126
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.039
Jason Swett: What I would entertain is the idea of doing a lower risk event.

127
00:14:25.796 --> 00:14:36.070
Jason Swett: Something where you know to Andy Kroll's point. If only 50 people show up, that's fine, it'll still be profitable, whatever. I don't want to pay a

128
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:46.479
Jason Swett: $26,000, food and beverage minimum for a two-day event like I had to for Sin City ruby 2025. That was nuts.

129
00:14:46.835 --> 00:14:47.190
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

130
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.879
Jason Swett: So that kind of thing.

131
00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.910
Jason Swett: And if I were to have it like in Michigan.

132
00:14:54.050 --> 00:15:04.010
Jason Swett: like driving distance from my house, that would be a lot different and and a lot better in a lot of ways, because, for example, I could like, just go drive over and scope out the venue.

133
00:15:04.255 --> 00:15:04.500
Travis Dockter: No.

134
00:15:04.868 --> 00:15:06.340
Jason Swett: Without having to like

135
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:19.759
Jason Swett: pay to go to Las Vegas like Fly there and do this whole thing just to check out the venue. You know. We never did that, because that wasn't a realistic that would just like eat away at the

136
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.809
Jason Swett: that would raise the expenses so much.

137
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.320
Travis Dockter: Right.

138
00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:33.175
Jason Swett: So I don't wanna have to do anything like that. I'd rather do something closer. I don't have anything specific in the works.

139
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.490
Jason Swett: frankly, for the last

140
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:42.000
Jason Swett: few months I've been kind of burnt out, and so I'm not ready to think about anything like that.

141
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.830
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

142
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:56.500
Jason Swett: I'm trying to shed things and lighten my workload and not try to take on new things. But when I'm ready to think about that kind of stuff. I think it'll probably be in Michigan if it happens at all.

143
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:03.166
Travis Dockter: So I'm actually in the the venue process right now.

144
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.090
Travis Dockter: What was it like working with

145
00:16:07.746 --> 00:16:22.380
Travis Dockter: the venues for for Sin city ruby. I know you had the tropicana the 1st 2 years is. And I know Vegas is probably gonna be different than a lot of places because they're

146
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:32.020
Travis Dockter: they do this right? It's the conferences are are a big thing there. So I'm sure it's a little bit different working with them. But what was like the process for getting a venue. There.

147
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:57.579
Jason Swett: It was positively awful. All of the hotel people are the absolute worst. You would think that this being their main job, they would be like good at it. But no, they're terrible at it like unbelievably and we actually one year we looked into doing a conference instead of Las Vegas. We looked into doing it in Puerto Rico.

148
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.010
Jason Swett: And our experience

149
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:11.859
Jason Swett: in both places was similar. Like, 1st of all, good luck, even getting a response from the hotel. Yeah, it's like, hey? We want to give you tens of thousands of dollars. Do you want to talk about that?

150
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:21.760
Jason Swett: No, they're they're not all interested in that conversation. And then, if you do get a response, it might be a really long time later.

151
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:31.678
Jason Swett: and they might like just totally miss really important stuff, or ask like inane questions.

152
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:44.500
Jason Swett: Ask you the same questions you already answered to them and and like pass you around to different people and stuff like that. And it's just an enormous hassle.

153
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:55.169
Jason Swett: I heard on a podcast. Once, this guy, Joe Paula, she said, a lot of businesses don't have a sales department. They have a sales prevention department.

154
00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.110
Jason Swett: and that's what it felt like I was dealing with. I was dealing with the Sales Prevention Department.

155
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.960
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

156
00:18:02.348 --> 00:18:14.499
Jason Swett: And then once I got into the process, okay, so you usually fill out because he asked about the process. I usually you usually fill out a form. They ask you like, how many people you're expecting, what dates you're thinking, and all that kind of stuff

157
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.930
Jason Swett: they'll contact you, and you know.

158
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:28.490
Jason Swett: give you an email that's worded in such a way that it doesn't make any sense. And you have to respond and ask, what do you mean and stuff like that. But anyway, a conversation starts

159
00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:37.830
Jason Swett: and and they're going to want some kind of deposit or something like that.

160
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:43.550
Jason Swett: So you do that get the scheduling taken care of?

161
00:18:44.108 --> 00:18:51.280
Jason Swett: Maybe there's a little bit of like negotiation around budget and stuff like that quite often.

162
00:18:51.520 --> 00:19:04.759
Jason Swett: In fact, I found this universally to be the case in Las Vegas. They require you to have a room block in connection with your event, because they want that, like guaranteed revenue from you. Yeah.

163
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.969
Jason Swett: So in order to do this one.

164
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:13.799
Jason Swett: we had to have you know, we were expecting, like we told them, a hundred people. But like we don't know, we just have to guess. You know.

165
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:30.930
Jason Swett: we said a hundred people. So they made us do a room block for a hundred people, and we had to fill that to at least 80%. And if we didn't fill it to 80%, then we would be responsible for for any rooms that we didn't fill.

166
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.329
Jason Swett: So that's a big part of where the risk comes from.

167
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:50.909
Jason Swett: And then and you know this hotel. I don't remember how much a night, but like multiply a couple 100 bucks a night times, 2 nights times 80 rooms.

168
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:56.350
Jason Swett: That's a pretty big number, you know, and that's the number that we were on the hook for.

169
00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:06.410
Jason Swett: and then on top of that. In this case the like $26,000, food and beverage, minimum, or whatever it was because again they want that guaranteed revenue.

170
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.969
Jason Swett: I think we spent like

171
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:15.370
Jason Swett: I don't remember. But it was. It was some. It was in the thousands

172
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.060
Jason Swett: we spent thousands of dollars on bottled water.

173
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.970
Jason Swett: Yeah, yeah,

174
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.220
Jason Swett: And you know, water. Quite a lot of the time is free.

175
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:27.850
Jason Swett: Yeah.

176
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:37.460
Jason Swett: just like in the world, you know. You can go to a drinking fountain and just drink some water. Nobody charges you. In this case. We paid thousands of dollars for water.

177
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.199
Jason Swett: so that was cool.

178
00:20:39.682 --> 00:20:44.620
Jason Swett: So I don't really recommend working with hotels, because they're just the absolute worst

179
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.940
Jason Swett: and they're like, not nice, not friendly.

180
00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:56.489
Jason Swett: It's just awful so screw them. I'm never going to work with them again.

181
00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:03.399
Travis Dockter: Yeah, I've yeah. I've had similar experience so far, where it's just it's

182
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:22.399
Travis Dockter: I also naively just thought this would be an easy part of the process, because I am going to give them thousands of dollars, and I thought they would, they would be selling me. But instead, I'm like chasing them, trying to to give them money.

183
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.968
Travis Dockter: Which yeah is confusing.

184
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:32.355
Travis Dockter: But yeah, okay.

185
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:43.700
Travis Dockter: How did you? You mentioned your your wife was a co-organizer. How did you guys split responsibilities?

186
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.900
Jason Swett: For 2025. She took care of almost all the hotel stuff.

187
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.610
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

188
00:21:51.610 --> 00:22:00.630
Jason Swett: So she did a lot of, you know, very painful work coordinating with these hotels. She handled all the

189
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.710
Jason Swett: financial stuff and all that.

190
00:22:03.753 --> 00:22:14.389
Jason Swett: Basically, I was responsible for the sales and marketing of it. And she was responsible for everything else. She made the website everything else.

191
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:21.120
Travis Dockter: Nice. What what did you do for for marketing? And did that change from year to year?

192
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:27.084
Jason Swett: Yeah, so kind of everything that I do is marketing

193
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:42.669
Jason Swett: whether I intended it to be marketing for the conference at the time that I did it or not. You know, like the podcast that I've been doing for the last, however, many years, 250 plus episodes worth

194
00:22:42.950 --> 00:23:08.799
Jason Swett: all that is marketing that benefited the conference. I didn't intend for it to be exactly that at the time I did it, except right before I did it. You know, when I when I knew that I was going to do it, but that helped all the writing that I've done that helped again, choosing speakers that had a draw that was intentional for marketing purposes.

195
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:15.437
Jason Swett: And then, on top of that, I would just like manually tell people

196
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:25.909
Jason Swett: like I do a lot of just like networking calls like, I email people and say, like, Hey, it's been a while since we've talked. Want to have a call to catch up, or whatever.

197
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:26.250
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

198
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.069
Jason Swett: I do that because that has

199
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:36.210
Jason Swett: it has a lot of business benefits. And it's just like I enjoy talking to people and having relationships and stuff like that.

200
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:36.590
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

201
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:45.459
Jason Swett: And so I did that before the conference. And I'm like, Hey, just so, you know, I'm putting on this conference, and a lot of people didn't know about it.

202
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.690
Jason Swett: and some people I told them about it, and then they bought a ticket.

203
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.519
Travis Dockter: So that was.

204
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:59.509
Jason Swett: That definitely worked more than 0 times. I don't remember how many people bought tickets because of that. Not a lot of people, but at least some.

205
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.250
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

206
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:08.480
Jason Swett: And you know, I talked about it. I talked about the conference on my podcast and on social media and

207
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.699
Jason Swett: sent emails to my email list and

208
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:25.630
Jason Swett: sent letters in the mail to my snail mail programming newsletter recipients. Yeah, basically, any way that I could tell people I was, I was using all the channels that I already had.

209
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.659
Travis Dockter: Yeah, yeah. So you you have a.

210
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:44.955
Travis Dockter: you're probably the 1st organizer that I've talked to who has like a a real following online. That you could kind of use to to help market this?

211
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.379
Travis Dockter: yeah, that definitely definitely helps. But I love that.

212
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:56.649
Travis Dockter: Just, you know, telling people that you're you're putting on a conference. That's probably something that

213
00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:07.450
Travis Dockter: you know you wouldn't think of as a marketing tool. But it does work, and especially, you know, if you're just putting on a a conference with

214
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.269
Travis Dockter: a hundred people?

215
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:17.899
Travis Dockter: you know every every ticket counts, and if you tell 5 people and they buy tickets, as that was well worth the well worth the time.

216
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:18.720
Jason Swett: Yeah.

217
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.250
Travis Dockter: I love that.

218
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:47.110
Jason Swett: Yeah. And and you know, I was talking mainly about marketing on the sales side. There wasn't a lot to that, because it's not like I was negotiating prices or anything like that, although sometimes I did, you know, sometimes people were like, Hey, I can't really afford 500 bucks, because that's how many, how much the tickets were. I'm like, all right, like, you don't have a job right now I get that like, what what could you afford, and maybe I'd give them the ticket for something less.

219
00:25:48.026 --> 00:25:54.630
Jason Swett: And that's still fine, because, like that helps with the hotel room, block obligation and stuff like that.

220
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.260
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

221
00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:03.090
Jason Swett: And I had people ask for student discounts and stuff like that, and my policy was just like

222
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.589
Jason Swett: whatever like I'll I'll take some amount of money.

223
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:20.110
Jason Swett: anything whatever, just to get people there, because it was almost more helpful to have people there than to have the revenue, because every like missing seat cost a lot of money.

224
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:20.980
Travis Dockter: Right.

225
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.919
Jason Swett: Yeah. And so just any way, I could get people there.

226
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:36.434
Travis Dockter: Yeah. So you you said lost money the last year, just because of, you know, agreements with the hotel that were exorbitant 1st year?

227
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.919
Travis Dockter: also, just because it, you know, small.

228
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.020
Travis Dockter: did you break even, or or make a little bit of money? How did that go the second year.

229
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.340
Jason Swett: 1st year lost about 2,000 bucks.

230
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.089
Jason Swett: Yeah, I think it was like

231
00:26:52.440 --> 00:27:04.210
Jason Swett: the costs were around 10,000. The revenue was around 10,000, but they were a little bit off in such a way that I lost about 2,000 bucks. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was.

232
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:04.720
Travis Dockter: Awesome.

233
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.180
Jason Swett: Roughly in that range.

234
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.420
Travis Dockter: And then how was the how was the second year.

235
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:15.240
Jason Swett: The second one was bigger. I think it was like 60 or so people who came to that one.

236
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:15.780
Travis Dockter: Nice.

237
00:27:16.265 --> 00:27:19.664
Jason Swett: And the revenue and expenses were more.

238
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:24.440
Jason Swett: I don't remember. Maybe it was like $30,000 in and out

239
00:27:25.015 --> 00:27:30.220
Jason Swett: and then we ended up making a few 1,000 bucks on the second year Gotcha.

240
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.939
Jason Swett: And the 3rd year the 3rd year was the worst.

241
00:27:33.414 --> 00:27:40.299
Jason Swett: Well, actually, okay. So like 80 people or so ended up coming. So it was the best in that sense.

242
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:40.620
Jason Swett: right?

243
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:49.189
Jason Swett: Financially, it was the worst, because we couldn't do it at the Tropicana anymore. We did it at the Mgm. Grand, and there

244
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.080
Jason Swett: they were much more expensive.

245
00:27:52.640 --> 00:28:03.980
Jason Swett: and they were stricter on what we had to have like. For example, at Tropicana we had no food and beverage minimum, but at Mgm. Grand we had that very large food and beverage minimum.

246
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.770
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

247
00:28:05.675 --> 00:28:17.300
Jason Swett: So I don't know the exact number, but when we when we settled up with the

248
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.660
Jason Swett: with the Mgm. Grand after the conference, so we paid them some amount up front.

249
00:28:23.808 --> 00:28:26.620
Jason Swett: And then, because we had like

250
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:41.830
Jason Swett: people missing from the room block, and we had to spend money on food and beverage and stuff like that. We had to like settle up after that, and they gave us a final additional bill, and that additional bill was about 20,000 bucks.

251
00:28:42.608 --> 00:28:46.432
Jason Swett: That doesn't mean we lost 20,000 bucks.

252
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:53.519
Jason Swett: but it was. It was in that neighborhood. It was like somewhere between 10 and 20,000 bucks is how much we lost.

253
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.287
Travis Dockter: Yeah. Was that

254
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:06.229
Travis Dockter: Was that why you knew it was going to be more expensive? Was that why you decided to have sponsors the 3rd year, or would you have had sponsors the 3rd year, regardless.

255
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:25.090
Travis Dockter: One of the things I I like about your conference is you keep it very simple like, you know, there's you choose the speakers you don't have like catering, you know, like you, you keep it very simple, and that's

256
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.534
Travis Dockter: very

257
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:55.023
Travis Dockter: I guess, inspiring. Or it's just like, Oh, maybe I maybe I can do a conference, because, I've been to Jason's conference. And it's amazing. And I know multiple people who have said it was their favorite conference, and it kind of shows you you don't need to have, you know, T-shirts and lunch and all this stuff to put on a good conference that people really enjoy

258
00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:09.609
Travis Dockter: and maybe maybe I could do it without a huge financial risk. Or, you know, without like having a full time job of of doing a conference. But did that? Did that.

259
00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:22.499
Travis Dockter: you know, keeping it simple was not having sponsors those previous years. Did that add a lot of work? And and did you just do it because you knew the the expenses were going to be more that year?

260
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:28.339
Jason Swett: I actually don't remember. But I think so. I think I did that because I knew the expenses were going to be higher.

261
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.120
Jason Swett: Yeah,

262
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:38.619
Jason Swett: yeah. And I don't think I would do sponsors again. Because it did add more work, and

263
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:45.780
Jason Swett: it not like work as in like a whole bunch of time, but just like it took up headspace, you know.

264
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.250
Travis Dockter: Right.

265
00:30:46.645 --> 00:30:50.600
Jason Swett: And it took up a lot more headspace than than

266
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.910
Jason Swett: the time it took, and it just felt kind of.

267
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.109
Jason Swett: I wouldn't say it wasn't worth it. But

268
00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:02.140
Jason Swett: well, maybe I would say it wasn't worth it, because I don't really want to do it again.

269
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:08.890
Jason Swett: and, to be honest, I don't feel like I serve the sponsors all that. Well.

270
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:09.650
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

271
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:18.430
Jason Swett: Like. I didn't have like banners with the sponsor logos and stuff like that, and I think some of the sponsors were expecting that.

272
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:24.200
Jason Swett: And so I felt bad about that, and I know that that kind of stuff

273
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:31.270
Jason Swett: is not a strength of mine. And with all this stuff like I want to play to my strengths and not try to

274
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:35.579
Jason Swett: not try to do these things, that I'm not good at.

275
00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.109
Travis Dockter: And then.

276
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:43.409
Jason Swett: That's a big part of the reason why I chose to do it, to do everything in such a simple way. Because I know that I'm not.

277
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:51.229
Jason Swett: I don't like administrative detail and stuff like that. And so I'm not going to try to take on a bunch of that stuff.

278
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:58.940
Jason Swett: So I think if I do an event again, I would go back to making it even simpler, and and just do no sponsors.

279
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.260
Travis Dockter: Gotcha. Yeah, that's a that's a an interesting

280
00:32:05.393 --> 00:32:07.960
Travis Dockter: approach, because it's almost like

281
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.780
Travis Dockter: did to have sponsors. And it's

282
00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:19.290
Travis Dockter: almost required because of the expenses of putting on a conference. So it's interesting to think about like, what a

283
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:26.574
Travis Dockter: okay, what can I do to to make this simpler? And could I do it without sponsors?

284
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:34.890
Travis Dockter: yeah, i i i want to think about that. I I'll probably end up trying to get sponsors.

285
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.709
Travis Dockter: For my event. But it is interesting to have the option to, to not do that.

286
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.470
Jason Swett: If I may ask, what what stage are you at in the planning of your conference?

287
00:32:49.813 --> 00:33:01.829
Travis Dockter: I am working on on getting a venue right now. I haven't reached out to any sponsors. I haven't reached out to any speakers so very early on. I'm planning to have it in

288
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.459
Travis Dockter: so about a year from now. So I'm giving myself

289
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:12.079
Travis Dockter: a lot of time to to plan it. And I'm glad, because

290
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:34.296
Travis Dockter: every obviously everything always takes longer than you think it's going to. And already, like, I'm like, Okay, the 1st step in a conference. I'm gonna do this step by step. 1st step is to get a venue. I'm like, Oh, that'll take a week, 2 weeks, Max, and that was a month ago that I started. So yeah, it's

291
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:41.659
Travis Dockter: It's I'm glad I gave myself a year. But I want to nail down the venue, and the date 1st

292
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:46.608
Travis Dockter: step is going to be sponsors and

293
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:53.729
Travis Dockter: trying to figure out like, okay, this is how much the venue is.

294
00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:22.040
Travis Dockter: I want to set my ticket prices lower as low as possible, so that you know, more people maybe can have the option of attending so that's gonna depend on how much sponsorship I can get. And I am in the position of not having a following online at all pretty much. I don't have social media. I have a linkedin

295
00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:24.469
Travis Dockter: that's pretty much it. Right? So

296
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:35.029
Travis Dockter: thing to say, Okay, what? If only 20 people show up to this? And they're all my coworkers, you know. So

297
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.430
Travis Dockter: yeah, the.

298
00:34:38.010 --> 00:35:02.761
Travis Dockter: I want to look for sponsors because I don't think I can depend on on ticket sales to any degree but I am gonna be doing a lot more marketing because I don't have that that following and I want to be really creative with that. And try to get this out to to a lot of people. But yeah, I'm in the very, very beginning stages. And

299
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:08.279
Travis Dockter: I have kind of have a picture of what you know is is coming next, but

300
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.200
Travis Dockter: very early stages.

301
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:21.740
Jason Swett: And and remind me, I think you told me, and maybe you even said, but again, the connection's been a little choppy. Are you having it in Albuquerque or somewhere else.

302
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.660
Travis Dockter: Yes, I'm gonna have it in Albuquerque.

303
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.380
Jason Swett: Okay?

304
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:31.370
Jason Swett: Okay, yeah. And for venues have you looked at like hotels? Non-hotels? What have you looked at

305
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.944
Jason Swett: right now? I'm talking with one hotel and one non hotel.

306
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:59.036
Travis Dockter: Weirdly, the hotel has actually been more responsive than the non hotel. I really like both of them, particularly because of the area that they're in is very walkable. There's a lot of like dining options. And I've heard from, you know, you and multiple other organizers to not do catering

307
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:10.803
Travis Dockter: if you can avoid it, and that area that they are in would be really easy. Because there's ton of dining options within a you know, 5 min walk?

308
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:17.480
Travis Dockter: so that's why I really like that area. And it's a nice area. So I,

309
00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:22.166
Travis Dockter: hoping to get one of those one of those venues.

310
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.884
Travis Dockter: so yeah. And I'm hoping that

311
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.818
Travis Dockter: Las Vegas is a lot more of a draw.

312
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:47.730
Travis Dockter: but I I think you know, I've talked to a couple people, and they're like, Oh, yeah, like, I've driven through Albuquerque, or I've been once, and I really liked it. I think people do have an interest to come here. We'll see if it's

313
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:56.149
Travis Dockter: strong enough. That that, it'll get people get people out here. But yeah, I I think that

314
00:36:56.721 --> 00:37:12.188
Travis Dockter: it's worth. It's worth coming out here. And I'm hoping to put on a conference also. That will that will make it worth it, because there's like 2 parts to every conference, right? It's the conference itself. But it's also the location people

315
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:31.910
Travis Dockter: would like to make a you know, a trip out of out of most conferences, so that you get the conference. But you also get to like, see a new city, or you get to visit you know some friends, or whatever it is, part of it for me with Sin City Ruby was. I had family out there, so it's great for me because I went to the conference.

316
00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:37.964
Travis Dockter: I would go visit my aunt and uncle for 2 days, you know. Stay the weekend with them.

317
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:45.639
Travis Dockter: so yeah, we'll we'll see if with if Albuquerque is a draw. But I I

318
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:51.819
Travis Dockter: especially my 1st conference. I didn't want to organize it in a place far away.

319
00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:58.649
Travis Dockter: you know, just to try to keep that as simple as possible, and and not add a neat

320
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:05.349
Travis Dockter: complications there that that would make it harder than it needs to be on my 1st 1st go around.

321
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:23.539
Jason Swett: Yeah, that'll be interesting to see a hunch that I have had about Sin City Ruby. Because, you know, you said that I have like a following online and stuff, which is true. But I really struggled to sell tickets for Sin City ruby. And it's not because people don't like the conference, because, like.

322
00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:23.929
Travis Dockter: You said.

323
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:39.019
Jason Swett: A lot of people really are enthusiastic about Sin City ruby. They they love it. Yeah, but the West is just really sparsely populated, you know, other than the coast. The west is very sparse.

324
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:39.420
Travis Dockter: Right.

325
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.979
Jason Swett: And so I wondered like, is it because there's not much local draw like

326
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:47.039
Jason Swett: there's not a big Nevada ruby community, you know.

327
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.610
Travis Dockter: Right.

328
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:54.049
Jason Swett: And I imagine there's not a huge New Mexico ruby community.

329
00:38:54.930 --> 00:39:00.102
Travis Dockter: Not huge. But there are a couple companies in Albuquerque.

330
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:08.609
Travis Dockter: that. Yeah, that I'm I'm gonna reach out to. And and you know. See if they will. Sponsor. See if they will.

331
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:08.970
Jason Swett: Hmm.

332
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:12.980
Travis Dockter: And some people. And there's also a

333
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:27.140
Travis Dockter: there's like a a boot camp, too, at a at a community college here. That I want to reach out to. So I'm hoping I can. I can get a a good number of people locally to come.

334
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.340
Travis Dockter: But yeah, we'll see.

335
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:49.549
Jason Swett: Yeah. And I do think people would find it an interesting place to visit. I think there's something to the idea of like visiting a place that you might not have visited otherwise like when when Adrian Marin had his conference in Romania, which is still going to happen this year, too.

336
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:54.140
Jason Swett: You know I never would have gone to Romania for any reason, otherwise

337
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.530
Jason Swett: nothing against Romania. But it just wasn't high on the list, you know.

338
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.218
Travis Dockter: Yeah. Super. Far away.

339
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.343
Jason Swett: Yeah, but I'm really glad I went.

340
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:11.377
Jason Swett: because, you know, precisely because I never would have gone there otherwise. It's like Albuquerque.

341
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:28.100
Jason Swett: you know you might. People might have a reason to go to like Chicago or San Francisco, or whatever, but not always Albuquerque, but they might be interested to go there, precisely because it's not somewhere that like work would take them to for some other reason.

342
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.812
Travis Dockter: Yeah, yeah, that's the hope we'll see.

343
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:32.960
Jason Swett: Yeah.

344
00:40:34.393 --> 00:40:40.460
Travis Dockter: Do you have any favorite conferences or favorite conference experiences as an attendee.

345
00:40:42.092 --> 00:40:44.930
Jason Swett: I really really liked friendly. Rb.

346
00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.700
Travis Dockter: Hmm.

347
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.390
Jason Swett: That's probably my favorite one, both because of

348
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.920
Jason Swett: the the organizers are great people.

349
00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:05.380
Jason Swett: and the location Bucharest Romania is great, and I took my family, and we took a trip up into the mountains in Romania and stuff like that. That was really cool.

350
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:12.289
Jason Swett: I think that's my favorite one. It doesn't happen anymore. But southeast ruby was really cool.

351
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:17.270
Jason Swett: Small conference that took place in Nashville. That was Jason Charnes's conference.

352
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.819
Travis Dockter: Yep. I just talked to him.

353
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.390
Jason Swett: Yeah, I really like those small ones.

354
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.656
Travis Dockter: Yeah, is it?

355
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:34.099
Travis Dockter: yeah. What? What do you feel like? The the differences are between like a rails Comp or a rails world where there's thousands of people

356
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:41.619
Travis Dockter: does the the smaller conferences like, what do you? What do you like about each of those.

357
00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:51.949
Jason Swett: With the big conferences. By the way, I really like rails. World. I've only been there once. I went to the one in Toronto, but I really liked that. I thought it was

358
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.915
Jason Swett: really well done.

359
00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:09.869
Jason Swett: At the big conferences like at rails world. I was just like flitting around from person to person, and I never got to spend a lot of time with any one person, because it was like everybody I've ever met. Is there.

360
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:10.220
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

361
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.670
Jason Swett: And so I don't want to like neglect people.

362
00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.350
Jason Swett: But I also like want to be able to spend more than 5 min with people.

363
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:24.059
Jason Swett: but it wasn't really possible. I was just being like bounced around like a pinball at the conference.

364
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.410
Jason Swett: So I just kept running into people I knew

365
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.090
Jason Swett: And so that's like.

366
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:40.470
Jason Swett: it's not exactly a good or bad thing. It's just very different. But what I like about small conferences is you can spend a lot of time

367
00:42:40.570 --> 00:43:01.099
Jason Swett: with people. And ironically, you can meet more people at a small conference than at a big conference, because you're just like in more contact with the same people you're like with the same group the entire time. And so you almost can't avoid meeting almost all the other people there. That's what I like about that.

368
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.570
Travis Dockter: Yeah, love that

369
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:10.085
Travis Dockter: Were there any experiences

370
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.400
Travis Dockter: specifically that you would like to see like.

371
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:23.010
Travis Dockter: was there anything about rails? World you said you love rails world? Is there anything about rails world that you think

372
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:29.270
Travis Dockter: we could replicate in smaller conferences? Or is it unique to that conference?

373
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:35.630
Jason Swett: I don't think it's unique to that conference. I really like

374
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:46.059
Jason Swett: Amanda Perino's mindset toward it. She's the organizer of rails world and the Executive Director of the Rails Foundation.

375
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:55.430
Jason Swett: She places a high importance on the venue, on the physical space that people are in

376
00:43:56.176 --> 00:43:59.379
Jason Swett: and I think it makes a really big difference.

377
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:03.329
Jason Swett: And after that one in Toronto.

378
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:15.909
Jason Swett: Dhh went on the remote ruby. Podcast. I believe it was. And he talked about how it really makes a big difference, being in a nice venue, that one in Toronto. It was like a

379
00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.873
Jason Swett: kind of indoor outdoor space.

380
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:24.630
Jason Swett: The the weather just happened to be perfect. It was like

381
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:37.720
Jason Swett: room temperature outside pretty much so you like kind of couldn't tell even if you were like inside or outside. It's like I'm inside, but we're breathing the fresh air of the outdoors, and you know,

382
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:57.539
Jason Swett: And there were like a bunch of trees inside. And so it was very green and verdant inside, and it was just really nice. It was like a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere. It wasn't some soulless, windowless basement or something like that.

383
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.050
Travis Dockter: -

384
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:07.729
Jason Swett: Which you know, most conferences are like that, and it's not the worst thing in the world, but it's just so cool to be in a cool space.

385
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:08.520
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

386
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.395
Jason Swett: So that was like that.

387
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.219
Jason Swett: My recollection is that southeast ruby in Nashville

388
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:29.649
Jason Swett: was in like a pretty cool hotel in a cool spot that added a lot to it. Friendly Rb. Had a similar thing going. They had a cool venue. And being in Bucharest, was

389
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:35.560
Jason Swett: it really added to it so I think the physical feel of the venue makes a big difference.

390
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:40.579
Travis Dockter: Nice. Yeah, yeah, I haven't been to rail's world. And

391
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:47.460
Travis Dockter: yeah, didn't get a ticket this year, either. But I hope to to make it one day. Because I

392
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:53.461
Travis Dockter: I've heard, yeah, just a lot of good stuff. About that conference

393
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:59.963
Jason Swett: And it's it's 1 of the few conferences that just sell out like that.

394
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.290
Travis Dockter: Which is is interesting.

395
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:23.429
Travis Dockter: I don't know. Why do you? Do you think that's because that, it's you know, it's dhh? And the Rails foundation behind it? Or why does that sell out so quickly? Why are people so so eager to to go to that conference that it sells out within half an hour.

396
00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:25.729
Jason Swett: Yeah, I think it's dhh.

397
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:26.390
Travis Dockter: Yeah.

398
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:31.170
Jason Swett: I think it's because, like that is the Flagship Rails Conference.

399
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.229
Travis Dockter: Yeah, it's a major draw.

400
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:56.869
Jason Swett: And you know again, Amanda does a really nice job of organizing the conference, but I don't know if people knew that that was going to happen. You know, people no one had ever attended one the 1st year that it happened, and I think it's still sold out like instantly. So I think it's just the draw of Dhh, and the fact that it's the Flagship Rails Conference.

401
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:58.099
Travis Dockter: Yep, yeah.

402
00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:14.979
Travis Dockter: okay. I'm I'm gonna put Amanda Perino on my list. So I think she was already on there. But I I would love to talk to her about conference organizing. But are there any other people that you think I should talk to about conference organizing.

403
00:47:15.773 --> 00:47:18.140
Jason Swett: I think you probably have

404
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:25.340
Jason Swett: all these people on your list already. But I mentioned Adrian. There's Jeremy Smith.

405
00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.929
Jason Swett: Jason Charns charge who you mentioned. You talked to.

406
00:47:29.735 --> 00:47:33.860
Jason Swett: There's Spike. I'm not sure how to say his last name.

407
00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:34.950
Travis Dockter: Yep. Yep.

408
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.530
Jason Swett: Organizer of Rocky Mountain, Ruby.

409
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.299
Travis Dockter: Yep. Yeah. Talk with him.

410
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:46.619
Jason Swett: Yeah, yeah. So I think you probably already have most of the same people on your list.

411
00:47:46.620 --> 00:48:02.000
Travis Dockter: Cool. Yeah. Last last bit. Any any advice or words of wisdom or inspiration for any other conference organizers out there that you have.

412
00:48:03.725 --> 00:48:05.209
Jason Swett: Don't do it!

413
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.590
Travis Dockter: No.

414
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:22.000
Jason Swett: No definitely do it, but I think I think a really good piece of advice is again the Andy Kroll advice. He wasn't even intending it as advice, but like

415
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:35.120
Jason Swett: design it so that it'll be design it. So it'll work out okay, no matter how big or small it ends up being. I think that's a really smart way to approach it.

416
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:43.539
Travis Dockter: Yeah, I love that awesome alrighty, Jason. Well, I appreciate your time. And I

417
00:48:43.660 --> 00:49:06.380
Travis Dockter: again, just I loved Sin City Ruby. It was part of the the inspiration for me to do this, because, you know, Cincy, Ruby, and Railsconf were the main conferences that I went to both of them ending this year. Kind of got me thinking like, Okay, what am I going to do next year? And then I was like, well, what if

418
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:10.111
Travis Dockter: I I try my own conference. So

419
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:19.050
Travis Dockter: thank you again for your time and for Sin City Group itself. And are you going to rails? Conf.

420
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:23.750
Jason Swett: No plans to as of now.

421
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:24.950
Travis Dockter: Okay. Alright!

422
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:29.650
Jason Swett: I'm not sure that I'm not going, but sadly, it looks like probably not.

423
00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:36.679
Travis Dockter: Okay. Alright. Well, I'm sure I'll I'll see you around other places, and I'll talk to you later.

424
00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.299
Jason Swett: Alright! Thanks a lot.

425
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.880
Travis Dockter: Alrighty, thanks, Jason.
